<h2 class="nobreak">INTRODUCTION</h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">This book comes</span> at a time when the American race issue
seems at a climax. Disturbing though it may be, it is encouraging
that such a book as this can be written, that a
group like the Black Muslims not only lives among us but
that it can be investigated and studied. This means that
at long last we are about to become honest about the race
question. Negroes are saying what they think; white people
are pausing to listen. These are the prerequisites of
dialogue in a free society, and I predict that on the whole
the Black Muslims will have a healthy influence on our
social structure.</p>

<p>I know white people are frightened by Malcolm X and
Elijah Muhammad; maybe now they will understand how
I have felt all my life, for there has never been a day when
I was unafraid; we Negroes live our lives on the edge of
fear, not knowing when or how the serpent of discrimination
will strike and deprive us of something dear&mdash;a job
here, a house there, an evening out over there, or a life
itself. But things are better now than they once were; I am<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
convinced they will soon be better than they are now. I am
optimistic because I feel Negroes are now determined to
better their lot; I believe we will win because there is every
evidence that white people are beginning to yield some of
their power, and that&mdash;power&mdash;is what the argument is
really about.</p>

<p>I have drawn on a spate of newspaper articles for this
manuscript. I must give particular thanks to my friends
Alex Haley and C. Eric Lincoln, Professor of Social Relations,
Clark College, Atlanta. Haley&#8217;s article on the Muslims
and his unpublished notes were of immense help;
Lincoln&#8217;s book, <i>The Black Muslims in America</i>, is the
definitive work on the followers of Elijah Muhammad and
it was my bible as I tried first to understand and then to
portray the Black Muslims. Dr. Lincoln and I shared research
when he was preparing his fine work, and he has
most graciously given me his consent to draw freely from
his material, particularly that related to the origins and
early history of the movement.</p>

<p>Thanks to Ann Westbay and Frances Hannah for their
work as typists. Both of them also served as valuable critics
as the manuscript took shape; for this additional service I
owe them much appreciation.</p>

<p>Most of all I am indebted to the Black Muslims themselves.
For more than four years, now, they have tolerated
my questions and presence, knowing that I differ with them
on many issues. Without their permission, over the years,
this kind of book would have been impossible.</p>

<p>The summer of 1963 saw the Negro Revolt move into
full view; it also saw the Black Muslims reach an almost
incredible peak of public concern and notice. The intent of
this work is to provide information and insight as companions
to that concern. For correct information is the
ultimate weapon of freedom. Even so, there are unpleasant
and chilling things in this book. The Black Muslims&mdash;for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
some&mdash;are an unpleasant and chilling people, but freedom
includes the right to be chilling, and the Black Muslims
have no monopoly on unpleasantness.</p>

<p>In reality, Western man is on trial in this book. Without
the failings of Western society, the Black Muslims could
not have come into being; without the continued failings
of our society, the Black Muslims cannot endure. Here,
then, Western white man, is a bitter pill. Do with it as
you see fit.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">1. MAKE IT PLAIN,<br />
MR. MINISTER!</h3></div>


<p><span class="smcap">The ultimate comment</span> upon racialism in this republic
is that the all-black Nation of Islam&mdash;a Chicago-based theocracy
whose citizens are known as the Black Muslims&mdash;is
one of the few religions ever produced by the American
experience. Incensed liberals, Negro and white, will deny
my assertion that the Black Muslims are a religious body,
but the issue, both legally and theologically, has been settled:
Courts in several states have ruled that the followers
of The Honorable Elijah Muhammad are, indeed, adherents
to a religious faith&mdash;as such, Black Muslim prison
inmates have the right to hold services of worship as do
other convicts. And no one who understands theologian Paul
Tillich&#8217;s argument that religion is nothing more than one&#8217;s
ultimate concern can doubt that the teachings of number-two
Black Muslim leader, Malcolm X, constitute a religion.</p>

<p>Malcolm X is the St. Paul of the Black Muslim movement.
Not only was he knocked to the ground by the bright
light of truth while on an evil journey, but he also rose
from the dust stunned, with a new name and a burning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
zeal to travel in the opposite direction and carry America&#8217;s
twenty million Negroes with him.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is the day of warning,&#8221; Malcolm shouts to the
Negro, &#8220;the hour during which prophecy is being fulfilled
before your very eyes. The white man is doomed! Don&#8217;t
integrate <i>with</i> him, separate <i>from</i> him! Come ye out from
among the white devils and be ye separate.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nobody knows just how many Negroes have said &#8220;yes&#8221;
to Malcolm X&#8217;s call. Estimates of the Black Muslim membership
vary from a quarter of a million down to fifty
thousand. Available evidence indicates that about one hundred
thousand Negroes have joined the movement at one
time or another, but few objective observers believe that
the Black Muslims can muster more than twenty or twenty-five
thousand active temple people.</p>

<p>The Black Muslims are feverish proselytizers, however,
and they get amazing results from Negro prison inmates
and the abandoned black masses who live in a world of
despair and futility. Early commentators on the movement
pointed to their work among prison inmates as further evidence
that the Black Muslims were a dissolute lot. The
opposite has proved to be true&mdash;the Muslims have been
able to change the lives of these men once they emerge
from prison. While the percentage of repeaters among ordinary
Negro criminals runs very high, the Black Muslim
converts seldom, if ever, return to a life of crime.</p>

<p>&#8220;Many of my followers&mdash;and ministers&mdash;were once criminals,&#8221;
Elijah Muhammad boasted in Washington, D.C., &#8220;but
I changed all that by giving them knowledge of <i>self</i>. Once
they discovered who the devil was and who God was, their
lives were changed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All praise due to Allah,&#8221; the crowd of some five thousand
shouted as they leaped to their feet and applauded
with rejoicing.</p>

<p>Non-Muslim Negroes used to scoff when Elijah wrote<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
and talked about &#8220;knowledge of self.&#8221; They are less apt to
scoff now that a new wave of race pride has engulfed the
Negro and a coterie of clean-cut, well-dressed, polite, and
chillingly moral Black Muslim ex-convicts parade through
the Negro community each day.</p>

<p>The same general approach, teaching race pride as
knowledge of &#8220;self,&#8221; accounts for the success the Black
Muslims have among low-income Negroes. For these people
are in something of a prison, too; they see themselves
as failures and need some accounting for why they are
what they are, why they are not what they are not. These
needs are met when the wayward and the downtrodden sit
at the feet of Malcolm X and hear him proclaim the divinity
of the black man, hear him blame the white man for sin
and lawlessness and then go on to herald the impending
destruction of the &#8220;blue-eyed white devil.&#8221;</p>


<h4><i>Bean Pie and Beatitudes</i></h4>

<p>The life of the Black Muslim centers around his temple&mdash;sometimes
called a mosque&mdash;and the temple restaurant.
They are usually located close together, in the heart of the
Negro ghetto, and are the nerve centers of work and worship.
Temple services are held two or three times a week
and are generally preceded by family and group meals at
the restaurant. Families&mdash;most of them former Methodists
and Baptists&mdash;come in groups, the men dressed in black,
the women in flowing white, and the children wearing pins
or buttons to let the world know of their commitment to
The Honorable Elijah Muhammad.</p>

<p>The restaurants&mdash;like the Black Muslim homes&mdash;strictly
adhere to Moslem dietary laws. Muslim sisters glory in their
ability to prepare dishes that satisfy the traditional eating
habits of the American Negro without violating these laws.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
The best example of imaginative Black Muslim cooking is
their famous bean pie, something of a gourmet&#8217;s delight in
the Negro community. Negroes in New York have been
known to come to Harlem from miles around just to buy
a bean pie for the family table. The restaurants also serve
as business headquarters for the movement; they are the
distribution centers for Black Muslim newspapers and other
periodicals, the place where one is invited to have a talk
with a Black Muslim leader. Temple Number Seven Restaurant
at 116th Street and Lenox Avenue in Harlem is
where Minister Malcolm X holds forth: he can be seen there
almost any time conducting the financial affairs of the
movement and holding press conferences. Then, on a sign
from one of his assistants, Malcolm bounds out of the
restaurant to conduct temple service at Temple Number
Seven, half a block away.</p>

<p>Throughout the nation the Muslims generally meet in
rented halls&mdash;a Masonic Temple in one town, over a pool
room in another. Men and women enter the temple together,
but once in the vestibule the families are separated.
Everybody is searched thoroughly and all sharp objects, to
say nothing of weapons, are taken away. The search is carried
out by well-trained sisters and brothers who work
with the efficiency of jail guards. They assign a small paper
bag to each worshiper, and such objects as nail files, pocket-knives,
scissors&mdash;any sharp objects that might conceivably
be used as weapons&mdash;are put into the bag for safe keeping
until the parishioner leaves the temple. Even the ordeal of
being searched is made palatable by a pleasant brother or
sister who explains that the visitor must be relieved of all
weapons because once the truth about the white man is
explained, the visitor might run out and start his private
Armageddon before the &#8220;word&#8221; comes.</p>

<p>The men and women are ushered into the temple through
separate doors and are ordered to sit on opposite sides. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
auditorium is generally a drab room, one used by many
groups in the course of a week. In Birmingham, Alabama,
for example, the Black Muslims use the Masonic Hall auditorium.
The Sunday I visited the services there one could
see posters, fans, and other materials left by groups who
had used the same hall earlier in the week. The chairs of
the auditorium are arranged in rows, a wide gulf between
the &#8220;brothers&#8221; side and that of the &#8220;sisters.&#8221; Dark-suited
young men, members of The Fruit of Islam, patrol the floor
incessantly. They dart about, nudging children to silence,
awakening a slumbering brother or sister, and performing
whatever duties might come to hand, all the while keeping
up a rapid-fire &#8220;That&#8217;s right,&#8221; &#8220;You tell it like it is,&#8221; in
response to what the minister is saying.</p>

<p>The visitor finds himself inside a strange new world at a
Black Muslim service. Many religions separate men and
women during their services, but few Negroes are members
of such faiths and so they are intrigued from the outset.
Their sense of being in on something exotic, thus meaningful,
is increased when one of the lesser ministers takes the
platform and says a few words in Arabic. The Negro is
told that this was his language before the white man kidnaped
his father and truncated his culture.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>As-Salaam-Alaikum!</i>&#8221; the minister says&mdash;Peace be unto
you.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Wa-Alaikum-Salaam</i>,&#8221; the visitor is taught to reply&mdash;&#8220;Peace
also be unto you.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Black Muslims have little or no liturgy. They do not
sing in the temple, for they have not yet developed hymns
that enunciate their faith. The nearest thing I have heard
to a Black Muslim hymn is a plaintive and moving song
written by Minister Louis X of Boston, &#8220;The White Man&#8217;s
Heaven Is the Black Man&#8217;s Hell.&#8221; It is often sung in the
temples, but only as a solo by some gifted member of the
congregation.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>Many of the Black Muslims are excellent musicians; indeed,
they are sidemen for some of the best-known jazz
groups in the nation. I have been in temple meetings
where a group of brothers set the stage for the service by
playing a protracted jazz riff. The music was as complex
and as far out as anything you would hear at New York&#8217;s
Five Spot Café or any other den of progressive jazz. As
these accomplished jazz men play out their frustrations,
the audience sits in cold silence. Sometimes the musicians
come on a beat or a shading that strikes some common
chord, and the Muslims smile slightly and nod at one another.
When the music is done&mdash;it goes on and on until it
runs down, just as it does in the jazz clubs&mdash;the congregation
applauds, and somewhere a male voice can be heard
to say, &#8220;All praise due to Allah!&#8221;</p>

<p>Then the stage is set for the &#8220;teaching.&#8221; In lieu of the
cross, the focus of the Black Muslims&#8217; religious service is
a huge blackboard divided into two sections. On one side
is a drawing of the American flag with the Christian cross
superimposed on it. Under this flag is written, &#8220;Slavery,
Suffering and Death.&#8221; On the other side of the blackboard
is the half-crescent symbol of Islam, and under it is written,
&#8220;Freedom, Justice and Equality.&#8221; Under both flags,
running the full length of the blackboard, is the somber
warning: &#8220;Which one will survive the War of Armageddon?&#8221;</p>

<p>And it is against this backdrop that the minister gets
up to &#8220;teach.&#8221; Each temple has its own minister, who is
extremely well trained in what he is to say and do. And he
does it well.</p>

<p>The Black Muslims have but one message: The white
man is by nature evil, a snake who is incapable of doing
right, a devil who is soon to be destroyed. Therefore, the
black man, who is by nature divine and good, must separate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
from the white man as soon as possible, lest he share
the white man&#8217;s hour of total destruction.</p>

<p>This sermon, or &#8220;teaching,&#8221; is the high point of the service,
what everybody has come to hear. An air of expectancy
runs through the crowd as the moment to begin the teaching
approaches. This is stock drama for the Black Muslims
whether the meeting be a national affair where Elijah himself
is to speak or a local meeting where the temple minister
is to teach.</p>

<p>This air of expectancy is set stirring by the second-in-command,
who keeps up a running promise that something
good is about to happen. As warm-up man for Elijah&#8217;s
Washington, D.C., speech, Malcolm X electrified a crowd
of some five thousand in Uline Arena with this:</p>

<p>&#8220;You are here to get some good news.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Make it plain.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you must remember that what is good news for
some is bound to be bad news for others.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All praise due to Allah,&#8221; the people shouted back.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is good news for the sheep,&#8221; Malcolm continued,
&#8220;is bad news for the wolf!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Make it plain, Mr. Minister. Make it plain.&#8221;</p>

<p>The good news, as everybody knew, was that Elijah
would be there soon with a message of freedom for the
&#8220;sheep&#8221; (the black man) and a message of destruction for
the &#8220;wolf&#8221; (the white man).</p>

<p>The setting for local meetings is much the same. In New
York Minister Henry X gets the crowd ready for Malcolm
by saying, &#8220;We are here to receive a blessing. The truth is
going to be told here this afternoon.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All praises due to Allah.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The Messenger&#8217;s Minister will be here shortly with
word from the man who saw God.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Make it plain.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>&#8220;The Minister is going to tell you who and what you are!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Say the word.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then he is going to tell you who and what the devil is!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Make it plain.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then he is going to show you why you had better hurry
up and get out from among the devil before you get destroyed
with him.&#8221;</p>

<p>This brings the crowd to their feet, cheering. The side
door to the upstairs temple swings open and Malcolm X,
a tall, rawboned, Ichabod-Crane-looking man, strolls in
flanked by an Honor Guard. As he walks to the platform
his light-skinned, granite face is stern. He looks and acts
like a military officer who may give a fatal order any minute.
His clothes, always a size or so too large, literally
drape from his body, making him look more gaunt than
he actually is.</p>

<p>&#8220;Big Red,&#8221; as Malcolm was called when he was peddling
prostitutes and dope on the streets of Harlem, is a dashing
and handsome man. Women of all races and creeds are
drawn to him. He speaks with an authority that is all but
hypnotic.</p>

<p>&#8220;When I say the white man is a devil,&#8221; Minister Malcolm
shouts, &#8220;I speak with the authority of history.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right,&#8221; the people shout back.</p>

<p>&#8220;The record of history shows that the white men, as a
people, have never done good.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Say on, brother, say on.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He stole our fathers and mothers from their culture of
silk and satins and brought them to this land in the belly
of a ship&mdash;am I right or wrong?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are right; God knows you are right.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He brought us here in chains&mdash;right?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Right.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He has kept us in chains ever since we have been here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Preach on, Brother Minister, preach on.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>&#8220;Now this blue-eyed devil&#8217;s time has about run out!&#8221;</p>

<p>The people leap to their feet, rejoicing.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now the fiery hell he has heaped upon others is about
to come down on the white man!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All praise due to Allah,&#8221; the people shout.</p>

<p>&#8220;God&mdash;we call him Allah&mdash;is going to get this white,
filthy, hog-loving beast off our backs,&#8221; Malcolm promises.</p>

<p>&#8220;Say on&mdash;yes, yes, yes....&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;God is going to hitch him to the plow and make him
do his own dirty work.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, yes. Say on!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;God is going to take over the garment district and make
those white dogs push their own trucks.&#8221;</p>

<p>Men in the audience jump up and down and shout their
approval: &#8220;All praises due to Allah. Praise His holy name!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, now,&#8221; Malcolm says, &#8220;calm down, because I want
you to hear me. Now I want to tell you who God is. I
want you to understand who Allah is so you will know
who is going to get this white, dope-peddling beast off
your back.&#8221;</p>

<p>Malcolm smiles. A ripple of laughter runs through the
audience&mdash;you see, they know who Allah is; they know who
God is; they know just who is going to get the white man
off their backs. But they have come to hear Malcolm &#8220;make
it plain&#8221; again.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Honorable Elijah Muhammad teaches us that God&mdash;Allah&mdash;is
not a spook; we don&#8217;t worship any ghost for a
God. We don&#8217;t believe in any dead God.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Our God is a live God.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He is walking around here with you, among you, in
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; the people shout back.</p>

<p>&#8220;God is black, like you; God is oppressed, like you; He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
looks like you; He acts like you; He walks like you; He
talks like you....&#8221;</p>

<p>By this time, the people are back on their feet cheering.
But Malcolm has gone as far toward describing God as he
will go for a while.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; he says, &#8220;you have to listen with understanding
to know what I am talking about.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We with you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t let white devils in our meetings.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no, no!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But we have to worry about some of you because the
white man has messed up your mind so bad that some of
you will run back and tell everything. That&#8217;s why we can&#8217;t
tell you everything; that&#8217;s why you have to listen carefully
and with understanding if you are going to find out just
who God is. But if He walks like you, and looks like you,
and talks like you, and suffers like you; and if He is with
you, in you, and all around you ... then ... well, you
figure it out!&#8221;</p>

<p>The people, particularly the men, lift their voices in a
long shout, for they have again been told that the black
man, taken collectively, is God&mdash;Allah&mdash;that Allah will soon,
now, destroy the devil, the white man.</p>

<p>Malcolm X, as he does three or four times each week,
has &#8220;made it plain.&#8221; He has told black men that they&mdash;as
God&mdash;must deliver themselves from the evils and hurts of
the white man. And that, of course, is what they came to
temple to hear.</p>

<p>On another Sunday afternoon the message will take a
different form. Malcolm this time elects to make his famous
&#8220;deaf, dumb, and blind&#8221; speech. I, for one, believe Malcolm
is at his best when he deals with this issue.</p>

<p>The speech begins as Malcolm X literally heaps abuse
on his audience.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are deaf, dumb, and blind,&#8221; he tells them. &#8220;You<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
are lost in the wilderness of North America, and the black
man&#8217;s new day has been delayed because of you. Now I
am here to get you ready.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Make it plain,&#8221; the people shout back.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now the first thing you must do is clean yourself up.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, that&#8217;s right, that&#8217;s right!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You must clean yourself up both physically and morally.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right! That&#8217;s right!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You must learn that certain foods are unclean. The hog
is a filthy beast, and it is against God&#8217;s will for you to
eat it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You can never clean yourself up as long as you have
hog in your body.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Make it plain; make it plain.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you must clean yourself up morally.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right, Brother Minister, that&#8217;s right.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This white devil is responsible for all the dope and
prostitution you see here among us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He has filled us with his immorality.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All praise due to Allah.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He has so confused us that our community is filled with
addicts, thieves, and prostitutes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And you will notice,&#8221; Malcolm continues, &#8220;that these
are Christians who are dealing in dope and prostitution.</p>

<p>&#8220;And you and I know this is true because when we were
Christians we used dope.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We lied.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We stole.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>&#8220;We were unfaithful to our wives.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We did everything antisocial and immoral.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But now that we know who God is, now that we have
found Allah&mdash;our original true God&mdash;now that we have
learned love and respect for self, now that all this has
happened, we have cleaned ourselves up.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All praises due to Allah.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We love our own black women.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We protect our women and children from the devil and
his works.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And we have stopped turning the other cheek!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We respect authority, but we are ready to fight and die
in defense of our lives.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All praises due to Allah!&#8221;</p>

<p>Broadsides at Christianity delivered by Malcolm X and
other ministers seem to make the strongest impression on
the audience. The minister explains that the Negro was
introduced to Christianity while a slave, a bondsman to the
man who taught him about Jesus. Employing any history
text, he reads at length, using &#8220;the white man&#8217;s own writings
to show that Christianity is a white man&#8217;s religion.&#8221;
This strikes home, because the average Negro has read
enough to know that there is a good deal of historical
soundness in what the minister says. Then the minister goes
on to point out that the Christian church (and they quote
Adam Clayton Powell on this) &#8220;is the most segregated
institution in America.&#8221; And the Negro does not need a
history book to know that this statement has total validity.</p>

<p>Then the minister goes on to attack Christianity on the
grounds that its practitioners are immoral. He calls the roll<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
of criminals and public failures, making much of the fact
that they are &#8220;all Christians.&#8221; The minister uses clippings
from the newspapers showing white clergymen and church-goers
either sanctioning segregation or being neutral about
it. During the Birmingham crisis I attended the Black Muslim
service and saw Minister James X deliver a devastating
indictment of Christianity simply by showing pictures of
Birmingham Negroes being turned away from white
churches. One picture showed the rebuffed Negroes praying
on the church steps while white bullies, their fists balled
up, stood near-by.</p>

<p>Black Christians are also indicted for immorality; the
minister points out that &#8220;All of us were once in the church
and we did everything evil.&#8221; I have watched this argument
at work and come away amazed at the way the Black
Muslims take the Christian ethic as a measuring stick; they
then arouse the guilt complex of the wayward Christians
in the audience and then go on to blame Christianity for
the individual&#8217;s moral failure. This, to be sure, is a contorted
argument. But it works. Christians sit in the temple
audience and confess their Christian failing, then they repent
themselves right out of the Christian church.</p>

<p>After the sermon the visitors are asked to raise any questions
that may trouble them. The ministers deal with each
question in detail, but the Black Muslim ushers (The
Fruit of Islam) make certain the questioner is not an &#8220;agitator,&#8221;
someone who has come into the temple just to start
a philosophical or theological argument.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are in here to be taught, Brother,&#8221; I heard one
Black Muslim say to a visitor, &#8220;not to argue.&#8221; And when
the visitor frankly says he does not understand what the
Black Muslims are up to, or that, after honestly trying, he
is unable to agree, the minister explains that this is not
to be held against the visitor. &#8220;You are among the deaf,
dumb, and blind,&#8221; the minister explains kindly. Then he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
assures the visitor that further study and estrangement from
&#8220;the teaching of the devil&#8221; will open his eyes and ears.</p>

<p>The climax of each temple service comes when visitors
are invited to join the movement. There is great rejoicing
when converts come forth. Eric Lincoln, who has attended
more of these services than I have, says that the larger
temples average a dozen or so converts at each meeting.</p>

<p>Once the visitor decides to join the temple, he is given a
letter he must copy by hand:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="right">
<span class="gap">Address</span><br />
City and State<br />
<span class="gap2">Date</span></p>

<p>Mr. W. F. Muhammad<br />
4807 South Woodlawn Avenue<br />
Chicago 15, Illinois</p>

<p>Dear Savior Allah, Our Deliverer:</p>

<p>I have been attending the teachings of Islam by one of
your Ministers, two or three times. I believe in it, and I
bear witness that there is no God but Thee, and that
Muhammad is Thy Servant and Apostle. I desire to reclaim
my Own. Please give me my Original name. My slave name
is as follows:</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="gap3">Name</span><br />
<span class="gap">Address</span><br />
City and State
</p></blockquote>

<p>This letter of application is dispatched to Chicago, and
if the copy contains no errors, the visitor is sent a detailed
questionnaire that inquires into his family and employment
status. This completed, the applicant is given a thorough
investigation by local members of The Fruit. If the applicant
stands muster, he is admitted to membership in the
Black Muslim movement.</p>

<p>Then, and only then, is the convert allowed to drop his
&#8220;slave&#8221; name. If his name is, say, John King, he becomes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
John X; if there are other Johns in the local temple, his
&#8220;X&#8221; will denote that he is the third, fourth, or whatever
number John to join that particular temple. Thus it is very
common to find John 2X or John 7X. Lincoln discovered a
midwestern Muslim whose name was John 17X. The &#8220;X&#8221;
is the Black Muslim&#8217;s way of saying that his own origins&mdash;before
the white man&mdash;and name are a mystery; it is also
the Muslim&#8217;s shout that he is an &#8220;ex,&#8221; and &#8220;no longer what
I was when the white man had me deaf, blind, and dumb.&#8221;</p>

<p>I have sat with Black Muslims during temple meetings
and have seen the people, particularly the young children,
come alive with a new sense of identity; they seem to have
a new reason to go out and do battle with the rats and
roaches in the slums that are their homes. A feeling of unity
and love for one another grips the entire room as they
silently stand to be dismissed.</p>

<p>They stretch forth their hands, palms upward, and in the
name of Allah, the most powerful and all-merciful God,
they vow to go in peace. But every Black Muslim temple
meeting is saturated with expectation. It reaches its peak
when the minister makes the promise that the War of
Armageddon is drawing closer and closer. No one ever
really says it, but there is an intense feeling that one day
soon, at just such a meeting, the &#8220;word&#8221;&mdash;probably from
Elijah Muhammad but through Malcolm X&mdash;will be given.
Just what the word is nobody says; just what will happen
when the word is given nobody seems to know. Yet everybody&mdash;man,
woman, and child&mdash;is determined to be on
hand when the &#8220;word&#8221; comes.</p>

<p>Such meetings as these have been going on all over the
nation for several years. Most of us heard talk about the
&#8220;temple people,&#8221; as the Black Muslims were called, but
there was very little real information about them. Nobody
seemed to know just how many temple people there were,
how they were organized, what they were really about. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
consensus was that they were just another offbeat sect, one
of the scores of &#8220;Islamic&#8221; movements that have sought to
convert American Negroes during the past century. We had
no idea of the power of the Black Muslims as a religious
and political organization capable of rallying mass support.
But early in 1959 we got the message.</p>


<h4><i>The Alert Is Given</i></h4>

<p>Shortly after dark on the night of April 14, 1958, police
at Harlem&#8217;s 28th Precinct received what had all the appearances
of a routine call&mdash;a fight between two Negroes at
the corner of 125th Street and Seventh Avenue. The dispatch
officer barked into his microphone, and his orders
squawked out in a dozen radio cars patrolling the area.
The cars, their revolving red lights glaring, sped to the
scene of the incident. Police poured out of the cars, their
clubs at the ready, and began to batter their way through
the mob that had gathered.</p>

<p>One Johnson Hinton, a man nobody knew and who had
nothing to do with the fight, was one of the spectators who
had stopped to watch the melee. The police shoved and
knocked aside several Negroes and finally came upon
Hinton. What happened then is still a matter of argument,
but one fact is agreed upon by all concerned: Hinton and
the police entered into a verbal exchange and a policeman
knocked Hinton to the ground, his head split open. A police
ambulance was called and police took the position that
another Negro agitator had been subdued. But they were
in for a major surprise, and the city was on the brink of a
race riot. Hinton, it turned out, was a Black Muslim,
Johnson X, a member of Malcolm&#8217;s Temple Number Seven
in Harlem.</p>

<p>Within minutes after Hinton hit the ground the word
spread that a Black Muslim had been assaulted by the police.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
An hour later some five hundred sullen, angry Black
Muslim men put a cordon around the 28th Precinct Station
house where Hinton was being held. This meant trouble,
and plenty of it. Precinct Captain McGowan realized he
had the makings of a riot on his hands and sent out an
urgent call for responsible Negroes to rush to the scene
and intervene. One of the first to arrive was James Hicks,
editor of <i>The Amsterdam News</i>, a Harlem newspaper.
Hicks accurately sized up the situation and told Captain
McGowan that only one man, Minister Malcolm X, could
manage the crowd and get them to disperse.</p>

<p>The police captain asked, in essence, &#8220;Who he?&#8221;</p>

<p>Shortly afterward Captain McGowan found out just who
Malcolm X was. Flanked by several strapping, angry Muslim
brothers, Malcolm walked into the station house. As he
entered the door, he gave a sign, and the hundreds of
Muslim brothers surrounding the area knew their stand
was affirmed. The call went out for still more Muslim
brothers to converge upon the area.</p>

<p>Once inside the station, Malcolm X sat down for hard
bargaining. First, there was the matter of Brother Johnson
Hinton lying on the floor of a jail cell with his head split
open. Malcolm demanded that Hinton be given immediate
hospital treatment. This was agreed to. Then Malcolm went
on to place on record the facts of the affair. Johnson was
standing on the street, he was not involved in the fight,
he at no time disobeyed a police order, and the police
struck him out of sheer flailing frustration.</p>

<p>As Johnson Hinton was carried out of the station to an
ambulance, Malcolm walked out the door and paused at
the top of the steps. The dimly lit night was filled with
Black Muslims and onlookers. Malcolm made a slight
gesture, and, according to both police and editor Hicks,
in exactly three minutes the streets were empty. The hundreds
of Muslims simply vanished&mdash;at least the police<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
thought they had vanished. In actuality they shifted their
cordon to the hospital where Hinton was being treated.
And it was only after Malcolm emerged from the hospital
and gave another sign that the Black Muslims finally dispersed
to their various homes.</p>

<p>&#8220;No man,&#8221; Police Captain McGowan said to James Hicks,
&#8220;should have that much power over that many people. We
cannot control this town if one man can wield that kind
of power.&#8221;</p>

<p>Johnson Hinton now walks around with a silver plate in
his head. An all-white jury awarded him seventy-five thousand
dollars in damages against the City of New York.
Those knowledgeable about the case and the Black Muslims
feel that seventy-five thousand dollars is a small fee
to pay for the service Malcolm X rendered the city that
night. As the jury found, the police were absolutely wrong,
and as Negroes know, Hinton&#8217;s was only one of the Negro
heads that are cracked open without reason by the New
York police each year.</p>

<p>But there was a difference between Johnson Hinton and
all the other Negroes who get their heads split open in
Harlem: Hinton had black brothers and sisters who cared
about him; he was a member of a tightly knit congregation
of believers whose basic tenet is &#8220;fight in defense of your
life&#8221; and whose main social ethic is &#8220;be ready to exact
justice when one of your brothers is abused.&#8221; The Muslims
will deny it, but they have a &#8220;crisis system&#8221; that moves into
action whenever a Muslim is abused. It involves a telephone
pyramid&mdash;one man calls ten people and each of
them calls ten&mdash;that in one hour can produce upward of a
thousand Muslims at any given point in New York.</p>

<p>And the night Johnson Hinton&#8217;s head was split open was
the night New York police officials went into a huddle and
named the Black Muslims, particularly Malcolm X, as people
to watch.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The black muslims</span> have been in the national spotlight
for only four years now, although the movement itself was
born more than a quarter of a century ago. It attracted
some attention in Chicago and Detroit but did not emerge
as a national concern until Minister Malcolm X, then serving
as leader of the New York Muslims and as a sort of
roving bishop for the entire movement, burst upon the
scene.</p>

<p>As is all too often the case with white people, the Establishment
took one look at the Black Muslims and lurched
from apathy to frenzy. No one paused long enough to
study just what the Muslims believe, what makes them a
religion, how they function as a religion. One of the reasons
why this has not been done is that the Establishment,
both Negro and white, was afraid that open acceptance
of the Black Muslims as a religion would legitimize them.
Meanwhile, as I mentioned earlier, courts in several states
have issued findings that the Muslims are, indeed, a religion,
and as such enjoy the same freedom as, say, Roman
Catholics.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>But this is to get ahead of the story. In truth, the scheme
of events, both economic and moral, that led to the formation
of the Black Muslims first began to unravel on the west
coast of Africa some five hundred years ago. And we must
begin <i>there</i> and <i>then</i> if we are to understand clearly the
<i>here</i> and <i>now</i>. Prior, and basic, to a full comprehension
of the meaning of the Negro&#8217;s African experience, we must
pause and understand the role of religion in the life of a
people.</p>


<h4><i>The Negro as African and Tribesman</i></h4>

<p>American Negro slaves were captured from the west
coast of Africa. They were by no means products of a
monolithic culture. They represented many tribes and sub-tribes.
They spoke a myriad of languages. Indeed, one of
the incredible ironies of the &#8220;Middle Passage&#8221; was that the
African slaves chained together in the hold of a boat as it
crossed the Atlantic were unable to talk to one another
because they did not have a common language. Yet these
were not uncivilized people. West Africans had developed
a complex society, as Lerone Bennett, Jr., suggests, long
before European penetration. Their political institutions,
rooted in family groupings, spiraled outward into village
states and empires. They had their armies and courts and,
if this is of any comfort to modern Americans, their own
internal-revenue departments. Speaking of Africa before
the European penetration, anthropologist Melville J.
Herskovits wrote, &#8220;Of the areas inhabited by non-literate
peoples Africa exhibits the greatest incidence of complex
governmental structure.&#8221; Not even the kingdoms of Peru
and Mexico could mobilize resources and concentrate
power more effectively than could some of these African
monarchies, which are more to be compared with European<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
states of the Middle Ages than referred to in the
common conception, &#8220;primitive state.&#8221;</p>

<p>Agriculture, herding, and artistry were important to the
West African, but the concept of private property was not
widely accepted. The land belonged to the community.
The core of West African society was the family. Interestingly
enough, most of the African tribes constructed their
families along matrilineal lines&mdash;the family tree was traced
through the mother. On the whole, the West Africans were
a mixture of various stocks by the time of the slave invasions.
Centuries of interbreeding had produced Africans
of varying shapes, colors, and features. Although they spoke
many languages, they approached a semblance of linguistic
unity in that only four of the African languages had been
reduced to writing before the coming of the white man.</p>

<p>Whatever their tongue or color the West Africans were
a deeply religious people. No greater injustice has been
done to a people than that committed by spurious American
historical and anthropological writings which suggest that
African religion should be written off as infantile animism.
On the contrary, the West Africans had developed complex
answers to such major tribal inquiries as &#8220;What is
man?&#8221; &#8220;Who is God?&#8221; &#8220;What is life?&#8221; and &#8220;How final is
death&#8217;s sting?&#8221; At rock bottom, the religion of West Africa
embraced a concept of &#8220;Life Forces.&#8221; The &#8220;Life Force&#8221; of
the Creator was present in all things animate and inanimate
and was viewed as a particularized but microcosmic
fragment of the Supreme Being, God, Who created the
earth. As Lerone Bennett, Jr., suggests, this African concept
of God as a vital force in everything bears a striking
resemblance to Henri Bergson&#8217;s &#8220;élan vital.&#8221; Religion
formed the center of West African life. Every event took
on religious meaning. And there is no telling what towering
civilization might have blossomed and survived there
had the white man not made his intrusion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>


<h4><i>Africans as Moslems</i></h4>

<p>The character of this work demands that we examine the
impact of Islam on the black Africans, particularly on those
of the West Coast, if we are to understand and evaluate
the current preachings of The Honorable Elijah Muhammad
and Malcolm X.</p>

<p>Dr. John Hope Franklin feels that influences of the religion
of Mohammed on the African way of life have been
exaggerated. It seems certain that Mohammedanism had
little influence upon black Africans prior to the fourteenth
century. As early as the seventh century the Moslems swept
from Arabia over into Egypt. Subsequently, they moved
into North Africa with great success. But when they attempted
to penetrate the land of the black African below
the Sahara, they encountered complex resistance from the
kingdoms of Ghana, Melle, and Songhay, where thriving
cultures were already in operation. Some Negro monarchs
accepted Mohammedanism for economic or political reasons,
but their subjects clung to their tribal religions. The
Moslems were never able to win over the peoples of Melle,
Hausa, Yoruba, and Susu despite the fact that Negroes
were accepted as their equals. And when invited to enjoy
both the economic and cultural advantages the religion
offered, the masses of West African Negroes rejected Islam
in favor of their own tribal way of life.</p>

<p>It is of singular significance that Christianity was already
entrenched in North Africa when Mohammedanism made
its appearance there in the seventh century. The two faiths
became locked in a life-and-death struggle for the control
of North Africa. But in West Africa, the region from which
the bulk of the Negro slaves were taken, Christianity was
all but unknown until the Portuguese and Spanish set up
their missions in the sixteenth century. Almost from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
onset Christianity was beset by moral ambivalence; on the
one hand the Spanish and Portuguese missionaries espoused
a doctrine of equality and brotherhood while on the other
hand Spanish and Portuguese slave traders were seizing
thousands of Africans and shipping them off to the New
World to become slaves. It was thus aboard &#8220;The Good
Ship Jesus&#8221; that the first slaves arrived in America. As John
Hope Franklin comments, &#8220;If the natives of West Africa
were slow to accept Christianity, it was not only because
they were attached to their own particular form of tribal
worship, but because it was beyond the capacity of the
unsophisticated West African mind to reconcile the teaching
of brotherhood and the practice of slavery by the white
interlopers.&#8221; The European Christians, however, found no
conflict between Christ and slavery and by 1860 the twenty
Negroes who landed at Jamestown in 1619 had become
four million.</p>


<h4><i>The Lord&#8217;s Song in a Strange Land</i></h4>

<p>The literature of the American Negro rumbles with the
controversy over the transplantation, or lack of it, of African
culture. Some Africanisms have survived in the New World,
particularly in the West Indies and in Haiti. But the impact
of the New World culture upon the Africans&mdash;who were
already culturally diffused&mdash;was decisive.</p>

<p>What happened to the African is exemplified by the
pious captain who held prayer service twice a day on his
slave ship. After the prayer services were over, he retired
to his cabin and wrote the now-famous hymn which begins
&#8220;How sweet the Name of Jesus sounds in a believer&#8217;s ear,
it quells the sorrow, drowns his fears, and drives away his
tears.&#8221; Further evidence of the complete Americanization
of the African lies in the fact that descendants of the first
Negro slaves&mdash;Negro Christians born in Spain and Portugal&mdash;settled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
in the New World long before the <i>Mayflower</i>
came. These Negroes were explorers, not slaves. Some of
them accompanied the French into the Mississippi Valley,
and others went with the Portuguese into South America.
Thirty Negroes were with Balboa when he discovered the
Pacific Ocean, and several were with Menéndez as he
marched into Florida.</p>

<p>The bulk of the Negroes in America are descendants, at
least partially, of Africans who arrived in this country first
as indentured servants and who were then lowered into
slavery. It was under the aegis of slavery that the black
American accepted Jehovah as his God. It is this ignominious
first meeting between Jesus and the black American
that Malcolm X probes so accurately and exploits so effectively.</p>


<h4><i>Christ and His Cotton Curtain</i></h4>

<p>When the Black Muslims call upon American Negroes
to forsake Christianity and return to Islam, they not only
flirt with historical inaccuracy, but they declare open war
against the Negro church, which has been properly described
by E. Franklin Frazier as the most important institution
the American Negro has built. That the Black
Muslims have had remarkable success in leading thousands
of Negroes out of the Christian church and into the temples
of Islam is clear evidence that somewhere in the history
of American Christendom faith failed the Negro. And
when it is realized that the Black Muslims are able to
attract three times as many fellow travelers as they do
members, the failure of Christianity becomes even more
pronounced. How and why that failure came about lies
deep in the swamps and plantations of the South, and we
must return there and examine the record of that failure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
if we are to grasp fully the meaning of Malcolm X when
he says, &#8220;Christianity is a white man&#8217;s religion.&#8221;</p>

<p>Every people has a sense of the past, the handed-down
record of what has gone before, the Ark of the Covenant,
as the collective experience of a people. For the American
Negro this sense of the past begins in America, not Africa,
for it was in America that the American Negro was forged
into a people. Under the tutelage of white plantation masters
the first slaves discovered a common language that
made it possible for them to communicate with each other
and thus make a collective expression of their resentment
of the peculiar institution known as slavery. The white slave
owner was Christian, and despite some efforts to prohibit
Negro exposure to the Bible, most slave masters or, more
particularly, their wives&mdash;saw to it that the slaves heard the
gospel. One of the moving scenes of American history is
that of slave and slave master gathered together in church
on the plantation to hear the gospel of a Christ of brotherhood.
Most plantation masters saw to it that the minister
kept his sermon confined to such texts as &#8220;Servants, be
obedient to them that are your masters&#8221; (Ephesians 6:5).
There was a deeper meaning for the slave in the religious
life of the plantation. Strangely enough, it was the Old
Testament with its rich history of the Jews and their bouts
with famines, pestilence, idolatry, and slavery that attracted
the imagination of the religious slave. Working in the field
by day, having his wife sold away from him down the
river to another plantation, seeing his son stripped naked
to the waist and given a hundred lashes for being &#8220;uppity,&#8221;
the Negro slave found a cruel parallel between his life and
that of those who begged favor to let them return to their
homeland and who finally were delivered by God, who
visited a series of disasters upon the slave master. Here in
the Negro plantation church&mdash;called by scholars &#8220;The Invisible
Institution&#8221;&mdash;the Negro began to translate the history<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
of the Jews into words of deliverance and hope. It was
thus that slaves began to translate the social history of the
Jews into Negro spirituals:</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Didn&#8217;t my Lord deliver Daniel?</i></p>

<p><i>Go down, Moses, way down in Egypt land, tell Old Pharaoh
let my people go....</i></p>

<p><i>We are climbing Jacob&#8217;s ladder, every round goes higher
and higher.... Soldiers of the Cross</i></p>

<p><i>Jordan&#8217;s river is chilly and cold, none can cross but the
true and bold....</i></p>

<p><i>Swing low, sweet chariot, coming for to carry me home....</i></p>

<p><i>Soon I will be done with the troubles of the world, going
home to live with God....</i></p></blockquote>

<p>At first it appeared that the American church would embrace
integration of the Negro and lead the attack against
the institution of slavery. In 1784, for example, the Methodist
Church declared slavery &#8220;contrary to the golden laws
of God&#8221; and went on to order its members to set all slaves
free within twelve months. But Southern states led by Virginia
forced a suspension of the resolution. Five years later
the Baptist Church passed pretty much the same resolution.
But it, too, recanted under pressure from the Deep South.
Even so, many churches accepted Negroes as parishioners,
though many whites feared that they could be flirting with
disaster if they adopted a truly liberal policy with respect
to Negro membership. By the same token, they were leery
of all Negro churches on the plantation. They feared that
Negro ministers and church officials would exercise considerable
authority over their slave communicants and thus
the church could become a center of rebellion. The American
church was having other problems at the time, and its
concern with the Negro question was not prime. The
Anglican clergy, flouting their Toryism, were causing many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
American parishioners to seek complete disassociation from
the Church of England. In fact, every religious denomination,
with the exception of the Roman Catholic, was busy
establishing an American wing of its church in the hope
that it would be completely separate from its European
sponsor. The Catholic Church itself finally acquiesced and
became separate under the control of a special Prefect
Apostolic. This intercontinental war between the churches
of the New World and the Old eclipsed the problem of the
Negro as far as white churchmen were concerned and set
the scene for the establishment of separate churches for
Negroes.</p>

<p>Negro Baptist churches began to sprout while the war
for independence was still being waged. George Liele, a
Negro leader, founded a Baptist church in Savannah,
Georgia, in 1779 that became the nucleus of the Negro Baptists
in that state. Virginia Negroes organized a Baptist
church in Petersburg in 1776, in Richmond in 1780, and in
Williamsburg in 1785. According to Dr. John Hope Franklin,
many of the white clergy in Virginia assisted Negroes
in setting up and organizing their separate churches.</p>

<p>It was in the North that the Negro church really burgeoned.
Foremost among the Northern Negro churchmen
was Richard Allen, an ex-slave who had purchased his freedom
from his Delaware master in 1777, the year he also
accepted Christ as his saviour. In 1786 Allen moved to
Philadelphia and began to hold prayer meetings for
Negroes. His efforts to establish a Negro church were
opposed by whites and some Negroes. But when the officials
of St. George&#8217;s Church, where Allen frequently
preached, began to segregate a large number of Negroes
who came to hear him, it became clear to Allen&#8217;s Negro
detractors that the time was right for a Negro church. The
final break came when white church officials pulled Allen,
Absalom Jones, and William White from their knees while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
they were praying in what had been set aside as the white
section of the church. An innately dramatic man, Allen led
the Negroes out of St. George&#8217;s Church and organized
Mother Bethel, now the central church of Negro Methodism.
Allen and his followers organized what became the
African Methodist Episcopal Church and by 1820 they had
four thousand followers in Philadelphia alone. The organization
spread as far west as Pittsburgh and as far south as
Charleston.</p>

<p>In New York City, because of discrimination and segregation
Negroes withdrew from the John Street Methodist
Episcopal Church and established what is now the African
Methodist Episcopal Zion Church, one of whose leading
bishops is Dr. Stephen Gill Spottswood, the current chairman
of the board of the NAACP. The same trend was
developing among Negro Baptists of the North. In 1809 thirteen
Negro members of a white Baptist church in Philadelphia
were dismissed to form a church of their own.
The Negro Baptists of Boston set up their own church in
the same year under the leadership of Reverend Thomas
Paul. At the same time he was shepherding the Boston congregation,
Rev. Paul also organized a Negro Baptist church
in New York City. The church was later named Abyssinian
and is now pastored by the controversial minister-politician,
Adam Clayton Powell, Jr.</p>

<p>Both white and Negro clergymen agree that the development
of separate churches was inconsistent with the teachings
of religion, but the Negro clergymen were adamant,
feeling that a separate church would give them an opportunity
to develop leadership. More, there were theological
points that Negro churchmen found difficult to accept. One
was the notion, widely held among white Christians particularly
in the South, that the Negro was the descendant of
Ham, the son of Noah, who laughed at his father&#8217;s nakedness
and thus doomed himself and his descendants to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
hewers of wood and drawers of water&mdash;that is to say, servants&mdash;to
the descendants of Noah&#8217;s other sons. This theological
justification for the concept of Negro inferiority reached
its peak during the early part of the nineteenth century,
when a spurious body of anthropological and biological
scholarship offered &#8220;scientific proof&#8221; of the Negro&#8217;s innate
inferiority both as a spiritual being and as a person. It was
the &#8220;Linnaean Web&#8221; that did it: scientists at that time completely
embraced the notions of Linnaeus that the classification
of peoples in terms of skull sizes and shapes as well
as in terms of color was the first step toward knowledge.
The American scene of the early 1800s was peopled with
a variety of racial stocks, and the majority of the white
Protestant group fell victims of the all-too-easy temptation
to judge the worth of an individual merely by looking at
the color of his skin or the shape of his nose. Thus, the
image of the hook-nosed Jewish peddler; the drunken,
shiftless Irishman; the stupid, soggy German; the hot-tempered
Italian; and the ragged, lazy Negro.</p>

<p>Only in the Negro church, then, did the Negro find a
sense of dignity and meaning. Only there was he made to
feel a true and equal child of God. The Negro church developed
a peculiar theology that spoke to the frustration
of the American Negro, and it was there that the Negro
translated Christianity into the hope of Negro deliverance.</p>

<p>But two factors, hardly noticed at the time, were to keep
the Negro church from becoming a completely closed institution:
first, the Negro church was a part of the Negro
community, which was an affront to every sensitive Negro
citizen; the Negro community was an enclave of terror and
police brutality, and the growing ambition of every Negro
was somehow to escape this troubled land and live out his
days in a less menacing atmosphere. The other factor that
operated against the Negro church was its consuming concern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
with the salvation of souls, the readying of men for
full and total adjustment in the world beyond the grave.
Like its white counterpart, the Negro church neglected the
social ethic, was unconcerned about where men would
live, what they would eat, and how they would clothe
themselves on this side of the Jordan.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the nation lunged from slavery through Reconstruction
into the race riots of the early 1900s. White
attitudes hardened, segregation signs sprouted over every
bathroom and drinking fountain, in every railroad train and
bus, and the white segregationist invoked the name of God
to justify his lynchings, police brutality, injustice before
the law, as well as the denial of every right the Constitution
had given to the Negro.</p>

<p>Negro churchmen realized the situation was getting
grave. A young theologian, Benjamin E. Mays, now President
of Morehouse College, and one of the three American
official mourners at the funeral of Pope John XXIII, wrote
his doctoral thesis on the Negroes&#8217; God. That was almost
forty years ago, and even then Dr. Mays suspected that the
Negroes&#8217; religion had better take on more militancy and
that this militancy should be rooted in some kind of God
concept.</p>

<p>At the end of World War II American Negro soldiers&mdash;so
movingly described in John Oliver Killens&#8217; novel <i>And
Then We Heard the Thunder</i>&mdash;came home determined to
do something about their own society. The children of these
soldiers are now marching the streets of Birmingham, Jackson,
and New York City. They were spawned by the same
era that produced Malcolm X and comedian Dick Gregory,
both of whom are part and parcel of the same movement.
It is not coincidental that the freedom riders and Malcolm
X came upon the scene at the same time. They both
emerged from a growing Negro consensus that old paths
have led nowhere, that they lead the wandering Negro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
around and around the foot of the mountain but never lead
him on toward his goal.</p>


<h4><i>The Peddler of Silks and Scripture</i></h4>

<p>Nineteen-thirty was the year after the big crash on Wall
Street. For the Negro in Detroit the crash had a double
meaning. It not only meant that he would be unemployed,
that there would be no money, but that the subtle discrimination
of the North&mdash;the very thing that had caused him to
leave the South&mdash;would become bold and overt. Into the
Negro ghetto of Detroit, late in the summer of 1930, there
came a peddler, a man of unknown origin and lineage, who
sold silks and satins from door to door. He was a strange-looking
man. Because of his pale yellow coloring, some
thought he was an Arab, others thought he was a Palestinian,
and others felt that he had come from India. He
called himself W. D. Fard on most occasions. Other times
he was variously known as Mr. Farrad Mohammad, Mr.
F. M. Ali, Professor Ford, and Mr. Wali Farrad. One of
his Detroit followers quotes him as having said, &#8220;My name
is W. D. Fard, and I come from the Holy City of Mecca.
More about myself I will not tell you yet, for the time is
not yet come. I am your brother. You have not yet seen me
in my royal robes.&#8221;</p>

<p>There are no documented facts as to just who Fard was
or where he came from. However, he found easy entry into
the homes of lower-class Detroit Negroes, who were eager
to purchase the silks he claimed were like those worn by
black men in Africa.</p>

<p>Dr. Eric Lincoln has gathered information showing that
Fard also used his presence in Negro homes to spread a
curious doctrine which, in Lincoln&#8217;s words, found anxious
ears &#8220;among culture-hungry Negroes.&#8221; The evidence suggests
that Fard mixed the peddling of silks with lectures on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
the black man&#8217;s past. He became known as &#8220;The Prophet&#8221;
and concentrated his teachings on his experience in the
Near and Far East.</p>

<p>Fard often warned his listeners against certain foods and
drinks. &#8220;... he would eat whatever we had on the table,&#8221;
one of his followers said, &#8220;but after the meal he began to
talk. &#8216;Now don&#8217;t eat this food, it is poison for you. The people
in your own country do not eat it. Since they eat the
right kind of food they have the best health always. If you
would just live like the people in your home country, you
would not be sick any more.&#8217; So we all wanted him to tell
us about ourselves and about our home country and about
how we could be free from rheumatism, aches, and pains.&#8221;</p>

<p>Fard was also well versed in the Bible and he used it as
a textbook while, at the same time, advising Negroes to
renounce Christianity. Realizing that the Bible was the
only religious literature known to the Negro, Fard skillfully
used it to support his version of the black man&#8217;s history and
the white man&#8217;s destiny. In the beginning Fard peddled his
wares by day and held house meetings at night. But as the
Depression deepened and his attack upon the white man
grew more bitter, the crowds overflowed the small living
rooms and dining rooms of the Detroit slum area. The followers
of Fard hired a hall, which they named The Temple
of Islam. And that was the birth of the phenomenon known
today as the Black Muslims. Fard seems to have been a
very friendly, relaxed man with an intuitive mastery of
mass psychology. His attacks on members of the white
race and on the Bible shocked his listeners into ecstasy and
many became converts to his amazing brand of Islam.</p>

<p>&#8220;Up to that day I always went to the Baptist Church,&#8221;
one convert said. &#8220;After I heard the sermon from the
prophet, I was turned around completely. When I went
home and heard that dinner was ready, I said, &#8216;I don&#8217;t want
to eat, I just want to go back to the meeting.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>It was inevitable that legends would pop up about a man
like W. D. Fard. Eric Lincoln has gathered and reported
them as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>One such legend is that Fard was a Jamaican Negro
whose father was a Syrian Moslem. Another describes him
as a Palestinian Arab who had participated in various
racial agitations in India, South Africa and London before
moving on to Detroit. Some of his followers believed him
to be the son of wealthy parents of the tribe of Koreish&mdash;the
tribe of Mohammed, founder of classical Islam. Others
say that he was educated at London University in preparation
for a diplomatic career in the service of the Kingdom
of Hejaz, but that he sacrificed his personal future &#8220;to bring
&#8216;freedom, justice, and equality&#8217; to the &#8216;black men in the
wilderness of North America, surrounded and robbed completely
by the Cave Man.&#8217;&#8221; Fard announced himself to the
Detroit police as &#8220;the Supreme Ruler of the Universe,&#8221; and
at least some of his followers seem to have considered him
divine. At the other extreme, a Chicago newspaper investigating
the Black Muslim Movement refers to Fard as
&#8220;a Turkish-born Nazi agent [who] worked for Hitler in
World War II.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>As for Fard himself, he said that he had been sent to
alert the black people of America to the unlimited possibilities
of the universal black man in a world now usurped, but
temporarily so, by white &#8220;blue-eyed devils.&#8221; This teaching
was a sweet shock to illiterate Negroes whose lives had
been spent in fear of the white man. They were irresistibly
attracted to a black man who would stand tall, call the
white man a snake, a devil&mdash;a blue-eyed devil, at that&mdash;and
predict that his reign over the world would soon come to
an ignominious end. And when Fard taught that the white
man was full of tricks, always to be suspected, never to be
trusted, the Southern Negroes who had come to Detroit in
search of freedom only to find futility could not resist the
temptation to shout &#8220;Amen.&#8221; As Eric Lincoln says,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span> &#8220;The
North was no promised land: It was the South all over
again with the worst features of racial prejudice thinly
camouflaged by sweet talk about equality.&#8221;</p>

<p>The black Detroiters who heard Fard were starving, living
in overcrowded slums. They were the victims of police
brutality, the continuing symbol of the power of the white
establishment. They were bitter toward the white workers
who took over &#8220;Negro jobs&#8221; as work became more scarce.
Even the white welfare workers in Detroit, according to
Eric Lincoln, deliberately abused Negroes by making them
wait long hours in line before passing out pitiful supplies
of flour and lard. All this fear resulted in deep resentment
and despair. The words of Fard began to make more sense
than ever.</p>

<p>Once Fard had secured a temple, the frequency of his
meetings was stepped up and the movement became more
formalized. Prospective members were put through rigid
examinations and were called upon to make commitments
and pledges. The sermons at Fard&#8217;s meetings were always
based on the same subject: the untrustworthiness of the
white man and the need for the Negro to understand and
return to his glorious history in Africa and Asia.</p>

<p>Eric Lincoln says that Fard, with no literature or material
to espouse his cause, used the writings of Joseph F. &#8220;Judge&#8221;
Rutherford, then leader of Jehovah&#8217;s Witnesses; Van Loon&#8217;s
<i>Story of Mankind</i>; Breasted&#8217;s <i>The Conquest of Civilization</i>;
the Quran; the Bible; and certain literature of Freemasonry,
to bring his people to &#8220;knowledge of self.&#8221; The followers of
Fard were encouraged to buy radios so that they could
hear the expressions of Rutherford and Frank Norris, the
Baptist fundamentalist preacher.</p>

<p>Once temple meetings began, however, Fard told his
members that the words of any white man could not be
trusted, for the white man was incapable of telling the
truth. He insisted that the white man&#8217;s writings were filled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
with a symbolism that must be interpreted. Fard went on
to establish himself as the interpreter and brought the
throng to its feet cheering when he said that the stupid
white man was actually a tool in the hands of Allah, that
the white man was a dumb idiot who unknowingly told
the &#8220;truth&#8221; and thus predicted his own doom. Fard himself
gave the movement its two basic theological pieces: <i>The
Sacred Ritual of the Nation of Islam</i>, still the key document
for the Black Muslims, and <i>Teachings for the Lost
Found Nation of Islam in a Mathematical Way</i>, a religious
cryptogram distributed among Muslims but which only
Fard could interpret.</p>

<p>Within four years after he had set up the first temple,
Fard, who turned out to be an extremely able executive,
not only had a burgeoning membership of followers, but
had founded a University of Islam, a combination of elementary
and high-school education devoted to higher
mathematics, astronomy, and the &#8220;ending of the spook
civilization.&#8221; To augment all this, Fard established &#8220;The
Muslim Girls Training Class&#8221; to drill Muslim women in the
art of being good housewives and mothers. And to put
down any trouble with unbelievers and police, he organized
&#8220;The Fruit of Islam,&#8221; a quasi-military organization in which
men were divided into squads headed by captains and
taught the tactics of judo and the use of firearms. Completing
the temple structure, a minister was appointed by Fard
to run the entire organization.</p>


<h4><i>The Man from Sandersville</i></h4>

<p>One of Fard&#8217;s Detroit converts was Elijah Poole, a Negro
from Sandersville, Georgia, and the son of a Baptist minister.
Poole was born on October 7, 1897, one of the thirteen
children of Wali and Marie Poole, both of whom had
been slaves. After completing the fourth grade&mdash;he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
then sixteen years old&mdash;Poole left home. In 1923 he and
his wife, Clara Evans, along with their two children moved
to Detroit. Of all the disenchanted Detroit Negroes, Elijah
Poole was probably the bitterest. The lure of Detroit had
proved a nightmare; he worked in factories at several different
jobs until the Depression hit in 1929. In 1930 Poole
attended one of the house meetings and heard Fard; in
Poole&#8217;s words, Fard took him &#8220;out of the gutters in the
streets of Detroit and taught me knowledge of Islam.&#8221;</p>

<p>Almost from the onset Fard and Poole seemed to become
fast friends. Early members of the sect have stated that
Elijah Poole became something of an errand boy for Fard
and also helped him publish a newspaper. The key fact in
the relationship between Elijah Poole and Fard was <i>time</i>.
Poole came into the movement at the moment police in
Detroit were breathing down Fard&#8217;s neck. Indeed it was
fear of trouble from the police&mdash;and nonbelievers&mdash;that
caused Fard to organize The Fruit of Islam. The same concern
caused Fard to organize his temple in such a manner
that he would seldom risk public exposure. Once Fard had
fashioned his tightly knit organization he appointed a Chief
Minister of Islam to preside over the entire movement.</p>

<p>Elijah Poole was tapped by Fard as the first Chief Minister
of Islam and given the coveted &#8220;original name&#8221; <i>Muhammad</i>.
Earlier in 1932, three years after he joined the
movement, Elijah Muhammad went to Chicago and established
what has since become known as Temple Number
Two, which is now the headquarters of the Black Muslim
movement. Trouble in Detroit, however, seems to have cut
short Muhammad&#8217;s sojourn in Chicago. The history of this
period is clouded by controversy, but the following is the
best sequence of events observers have been able to piece
together:</p>

<p>Shortly after (perhaps before) Elijah Muhammad left
Detroit for Chicago one of the Muslim brothers got into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
trouble with the Detroit police because of his alleged part
in the sacrificial killing of a fellow Muslim. It is a matter
of record that the Muslims did teach sacrificial killing at
that time and that Fard was arrested in connection with
the charge. Muhammad has written of the incident in these
words:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>He was persecuted, sent to jail in 1932, and ordered out
of Detroit, Michigan, May 26, 1933. He came to Chicago
in the same year, was arrested almost immediately, and
placed behind prison bars. He submitted himself with all
humility to his persecutors. Each time he was arrested he
sent for me that I may see and learn the price of truth
for us (the so-called Negroes).</p></blockquote>

<p>Muhammad gave Fard refuge in Chicago. Shortly thereafter
Elijah was named Fard&#8217;s first Minister of Islam and
returned to Detroit, where he took over the movement despite
opposition from several of Fard&#8217;s followers. Shaken by
his encounter with police, Fard withdrew from public
view, leaving Elijah Muhammad to stand as the public
presence for the movement. During 1933 Fard was seen
less and less; then, in 1934, he simply vanished. To this
writing, state and federal authorities have been unable to
solve the riddle of Fard&#8217;s disappearance. As Eric Lincoln
says, &#8220;All reports about the whereabouts of Fard wind up
at a dead end.&#8221; The report that he was seen aboard a ship
bound for Europe was never substantiated. The report that
he met foul play at the hands of Detroit police or some of
his dissident friends was never confirmed. And the dark
hint that Elijah Muhammad himself was in some way connected
with Fard&#8217;s disappearance has not been supported
by any evidence.</p>

<p>Although rumors persist to this day that Muhammad induced
Fard to offer himself up as a human sacrifice, there
is no evidence to support them. Yet as Eric Lincoln comments,
&#8220;It is interesting to note that Fard is honored by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
[Black] Muslims everywhere as the &#8216;Saviour&#8217; and is celebrated
as such every year on his birthday, February 26.&#8221;</p>

<p>Once Fard fell from view, Muhammad became leader of
the movement. He was able to bring many dissidents back
into the temple, but soon broke with the Detroit faction and
returned to Chicago to set up his headquarters. Muhammad
had learned church administration from his clergyman
father and was able to organize several new temples of Islam.
Fard was apotheosized and referred to as the Prophet
of Allah; Muhammad proclaimed himself the Messenger of
the Prophet of Allah. To this day, the wellspring of Muhammad&#8217;s
power flows from the fact that he was with Fard in
life and possibly in death. On one occasion he said, &#8220;I have
it from the mouth of God that the enemy had better try to
protect my life and see that I continue to live. Because if
anything happens to me, I will be the last one that they
murder. And if any of my followers are harmed, ten of the
enemy&#8217;s best ones will be killed.&#8221;</p>

<p>Fard and Muhammad shared an affinity for getting into
trouble with the law. In 1934 Muhammad refused to transfer
his children from the University of Islam to another,
accredited school, and he was convicted of contributing to
the delinquency of a minor and placed on six months&#8217; probation.
Eight years later the Messenger was arrested by
federal authorities, convicted of refusing to register for the
draft, and sentenced to four years in the federal prison at
Milan, Michigan. The indictment, however, alleged that
Muhammad taught Negroes that their interests were in a
Japanese victory in World War II, since Negroes were
ethnic brothers of the Japanese. Muhammad&#8217;s pro-Japanese
sentiments were probably influenced by Japanese efforts,
principally through a skilled operative named Major Takahashi
who was in Chicago around 1938, to proselytize
among the Muslims and other Negro groups. Rank-and-file
Muslims, however, showed little interest in Takahashi&#8217;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
propaganda, just as they had shown little interest in Communist
overtures in 1932.</p>

<p>Like other men with a messianic complex, Muhammad
seemed to grow both in stature and spirit behind bars.
First of all, he was clearly able to direct the movement
even while he was in prison, and once he was released, he
began uttering statements that made Fard and, indeed, the
early Elijah Muhammad sound conservative. In bold staccato
phrases, punctuated by clearing of the throat so endemic
to Southern Negro preachers, Muhammad shouted to
the throng that the white man is a snake, a devil by nature,
evil, incapable of doing right. Despite the fact that he was
still garbed in his &#8220;release suit,&#8221; Muhammad told the
Chicago crowd that it made no sense for Negroes in this
country to have fought against the Japanese, who were victimized
by the same blue-eyed devil who had victimized the
American Negro. But Muhammad did not stop there; he
said that the American Negro had had no stake in World
War II. &#8220;Rather,&#8221; Muhammad said, &#8220;the American Negro
should be saving his energy and ammunition for &#8216;The Battle
of Armageddon,&#8217; which will be waged in the wilderness
of North America. This battle&mdash;and this is one of the central
teachings of the Nation of Islam&mdash;will be for freedom, justice,
and equality. It will be waged to success or under
death.&#8221; Muhammad always titillates his followers by telling
them that he cannot at this moment let them know just
when the battle will take place and who the protagonists
will be. But one has only to sit in the audience and hear
his followers applaud and laugh to know that they fully
believe that the time of the bloodletting is nigh and that
the struggle will be between black and white.</p>

<p>Despite his boldness, the movement stagnated under Muhammad&#8217;s
leadership. In the mid-forties &#8220;The Big X&#8221; came
on the scene. And with the arrival of Malcolm Little&mdash;christened
into Islam Malcolm X and elevated by Elijah<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
Muhammad to be Malcolm Shabazz, but known to the
pimps, prostitutes, and dope addicts as &#8220;Big Red&#8221;&mdash;the
Black Muslim movement really began to move.</p>


<h4><i>Big Red</i></h4>

<p>Malcolm Little was born in Omaha, Nebraska, in 1925,
and like Elijah Muhammad he was the son of a Baptist
minister. The family soon moved from Omaha to Lansing,
Michigan. Malcolm&#8217;s father was a follower of the Black
Nationalist, Marcus Garvey, who felt that all Negroes
should return to Africa and escape the oppression of the
white man. The Ku Klux Klan burned down the family
home when Malcolm was only six years old. &#8220;The firemen
came,&#8221; Malcolm says, &#8220;and just sat there without making
any effort to put one drop of water on the fire. The same fire
that burned my father&#8217;s home still burns in my soul.&#8221;</p>

<p>Following Garvey&#8217;s teaching that the Negroes should go
into business, Mr. Little then set out to build his own store.
Soon after this, according to Malcolm, &#8220;my father was
found with his head bashed and his body mangled under a
streetcar.&#8221; Malcolm Shabazz to this day remains convinced
that his father was lynched by white people who resented
even the prospect of a Negro gaining some economic independence.
With his father&#8217;s death, Malcolm&#8217;s family was
forced to separate. In moving terms, clenching his fists,
and at times breaking into tears, Malcolm has described to
me how his mother boiled dandelion greens from day
to day trying to keep her eleven children from starving to
death. &#8220;We stayed dizzy and sick because we stayed
hungry.&#8221; At night Malcolm and his brothers would go out
and steal what food they could to fill their stomachs. The
Littles were a clannish bunch. They struggled to stay together,
but the pangs of hunger were too great, and they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
were ripped apart. Malcolm was sent to an institution for
boys.</p>

<p>This turned out to be the second molding factor in the
life of Malcolm X. He was one of the few Negroes&mdash;if not
the only one&mdash;in the institution and he developed a warm
love for the white matron who defended him when other
kids were &#8220;kicking him around.&#8221; In the only complimentary
statement I have heard him make about a white person,
Malcolm says of the matron, &#8220;She was good to me. I followed
her around like a little puppy. I was a kind of mascot.&#8221;
She arranged for him to attend a near-by school
where, although he was the only Negro pupil, his keen
mind put him at the head of the class, which only gained
him the resentment of both the teacher and the pupils.</p>

<p>&#8220;When I was in the eighth grade,&#8221; Malcolm says, &#8220;they
asked me what I wanted to become. I told them I wanted
to study law. But they told me that law was not a suitable
profession for a Negro. They suggested that I think of a
trade such as carpentry.&#8221;</p>

<p>That ripped it! Malcolm soon left school and came east
to New York, and in a matter of weeks penetrated the underworld
where he became a trusted lieutenant. Malcolm&#8217;s
early days in the underworld are described in unpublished
notes by writer Alex Haley in the following words:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Admitted to the underworld&#8217;s fringes, sixteen-year-old
Malcolm absorbed all he heard and saw. He swiftly built
up a reputation for honesty by turning over every dollar
due his boss (&#8220;I have always been intensely loyal&#8221;). By
the age of 18, Malcolm was versatile &#8220;Big Red.&#8221; He hired
from four to six men variously plying dope, numbers,
bootleg whiskey and diverse forms of hustling. Malcolm
personally squired well-heeled white thrill-seekers to Harlem
sin dens, and Negroes to white sin downtown. &#8220;My best
customers were preachers and social leaders, police and
all kinds of big shots in the business of controlling other
people&#8217;s lives.&#8221;</p></blockquote>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>His income often reached as high as two thousand dollars
a month. And I have heard Malcolm talk of paying off the
cops from a thousand-dollar bankroll which he pulled from
the pocket of his two-hundred-dollar suit. But not even
&#8220;Big Red&#8221; had enough money to pay all of the policemen
and eventually Malcolm X went to prison for burglary.</p>

<p>It was in 1947, in the maximum security prison at Concord,
Massachusetts, that Malcolm was converted to the
teachings of The Honorable Elijah Muhammad by one of
his fellow prisoners who was a member of the Detroit
temple. From that moment Malcolm has neither smoked,
cursed, drunk, nor run after women. He is the most puritanical
man I have ever met. I have interviewed him scores
of times but he will not meet me for an interview at any
place where liquor is sold. He does not object to my smoking,
but in polite terms he makes it understood that he
would rather I didn&#8217;t smoke around him. I have entertained
him in my home along with other guests, and he has sat
relaxed on the floor as we drink. He has never taken anything
but coffee, although he knows full well that none of
us would ever betray him.</p>

<p>Indeed, it is around the widely known and deeply admired
morality of Malcolm X that one of the few pieces of
humor about the Muslim movement came into being.</p>

<p>The story is that Malcolm was attempting to convert a
Negro Baptist to the teaching of Islam.</p>

<p>&#8220;What are the rules of your organization?&#8221; the Negro
asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; Malcolm said, &#8220;my brother, you have to stop
drinking, stop swearing, stop gambling, stop using dope,
and stop cheating on your wife!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hell,&#8221; the convert replied, &#8220;I think I had better remain
a Christian.&#8221;</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">3. THE NATION<br />
OF ISLAM</h3></div>


<p><span class="smcap">Any objective evaluation</span> of the Black Muslims as a
religious body must begin with a fresh look at religion
itself, its origin and meaning. The current, widespread
antipathy toward the Black Muslims makes such a basic
review of the roots of religion all the more necessary. Above
all we must shut out the voices of those who insist that the
Black Muslims are not a religion because they&mdash;the critics&mdash;don&#8217;t
like what the Muslims preach and do. After all, the
Mormon Church holds, among other things, that the Negro
is inferior because he is the descendant of Ham, the accursed
son of Noah. As a result Negroes are allowed to
join the Mormon Church, but are barred from high church
office. But none of us will take the position that the Mormons
are not a religion.</p>

<p>To understand the Black Muslims&mdash;and the Mormons,
for that matter&mdash;we must retrace that contorted and tribal
path man and God have walked together en route to the
here and now.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>


<h4><i>Religion as a Group Experience</i></h4>

<p>The world has always been a mystery to man. It excites
his imagination, challenges his courage, and piques his
intellect. But the individual never meets the world alone.
He is of his group; the group is part of the world he inherited
on the day he discovered himself and the other members
of his group&mdash;like the thunder and the lightning and
the sun and the trees and the rivers and the canyons and
the hurricanes and the manna trees that are part of that
which confounds him. Collectively confounded, then, the
group members react as one. They create a god almost
always in their own image and attribute to him all of the
omnipotence and omnipresence required to account for a
plot of matter spinning dizzily through space into nowhere.
And if he is in their image, then he is their father and they
are his children. He watches over them and protects them
from the pestilences that come by day and the evils that
crawl by night. They are his chosen people and he walks
with the warriors of the tribe as they go forth to battle
temporal evil, which is to say, anything and anybody that
differs from their tribe.</p>

<p>In return, the tribesmen insist that god make demands
upon them. And god grants their request: He commands
them to bow down and worship him, and to put no other
god before him. He commands them to love one another
even as they love him and he loves them. His commandments
on social ethics always parallel the social history of
the tribe involved. If one day some members of the tribe
feel sick from having eaten the meat from a given animal,
then god decrees that such meat is unclean and that it is
sinful to eat of it. If the social history of the people discloses
that the affinity between the man and his woman is so intense<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
that the intrusion of any other man or woman upon
that relationship brings on community disorder, then god
decrees that a man shall have one wife and a woman one
husband, and then commands that the neighbors covet not
the man&#8217;s wife or the woman&#8217;s husband. And when the
tribe matures to the point of having old men, elders, steeped
in the history of the tradition of the people, god orders
that the aged be respected and all be venerated as his leaders
on earth.</p>

<p>Thus it is that the god of a tribe becomes &#8220;their&#8221; god.
History is replete with battle scars left when the gods of
an opposing people fought it out on the plains and in the
valleys. When tribe meets tribe in war, at least one of
the tribes is bound to lose. But even in defeat the god of the
tribe becomes more powerful than ever before as the tribe
is convinced that, though it has lost a battle, it will eventually
win the war. Thus, in the words of one of the great
tribal leaders, &#8220;Our god is able to deliver. But if not, we
will not bow down and serve your god.&#8221;</p>

<p>Although tribal life revolves around the god concept,
few tribal states have actually become theocracies. Religious
leaders have taken their place beside temporal leaders,
and they function in concord, under the umbrella of
their god to make the state a practical institution.</p>

<p>With the dawn of modern history, gods began to fuse
and merge as people began to widen the circle of their
experience and accept the reality of tribal pluralism, and
civilizations that have survived to matter in the context of
the current world are those that fly the banner of the
world&#8217;s four or five major religions.</p>

<p>Modern man knows little of all this because he inherited
already thought-out religions. Thus he has no idea how
primitive and crude his gods once were. And it is precisely
because of modern man&#8217;s religious sophistication that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
Black Muslims rasp: At stage center, and before an audience
that is weary of racism and religious bigotry, the all-black
Nation of Islam gleefully re-enacts the shoddy scenes
of our cultural beginnings.</p>

<p>&#8220;We are in the image of God,&#8221; Malcolm says.</p>

<p>&#8220;Make it plain, Brother Minister. Make it plain.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That means that God&mdash;we call him Allah&mdash;must be black
like me!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All praise due to Allah.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;God was here in the beginning.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes sir, that&#8217;s right.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So we were here from the beginning&#8221;&mdash;and Malcolm X
smiles.</p>

<p>The people come roaring to their feet with shouts of
thanks and deliverance.</p>

<p>&#8220;And that which was here from the beginning must be
the daddy of everything else. Am I right or wrong?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You right. That&#8217;s right.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This blue-eyed devil talking about he is superior. It&#8217;s
about time he found out that we are his pappy!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Make it plain, Brother. Make it plain.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now listen to this,&#8221; Malcolm told a rally of three thousand
on a Harlem street corner, &#8220;and you will know why
black is superior.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Come on. Come, let&#8217;s hear it!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Black is <i>the</i> prime color. It is the strong color.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You can get any other color you want by mixing colors,
but you cannot find colors that you can mix and produce
black. Only black can produce black.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Make it plain.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And if black is prime, that means it is God, that means
it is good.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Therefore the less black you are the less good you are.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>&#8220;All praise due to Allah.&#8221; And now the people sense the
great truth that is about to come, and they begin to break
with laughter.</p>

<p>&#8220;Therefore when you are white, you are as nonblack as
you can be.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Make it plain, Malcolm. Make it plain.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Therefore when you are white you are absolutely nongood;
am I right or wrong?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You right!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In other words,&#8221; Malcolm shouts, &#8220;the white man is
therefore absolutely evil, a snake and a devil, and his time
of destruction draws nigh!&#8221;</p>

<p>With this the crowd breaks with joy. The applause lasts
for several minutes; white policemen standing guard at
the meeting nudge white onlookers, telling them to &#8220;move
on.&#8221;</p>

<p>This argument, that God is black and the white man a
devil, presents the Black Muslims with the identical philosophical
dilemma that has plagued most religions: How
could a good (black) God create a bad (white) thing?</p>

<p>The doctrine concerning Yakub is the Black Muslims&#8217;
attempt to answer that riddle. In biological terms of reference,
accepting the Muslim notion that the black man is the
original man, they must explain how the black race produced
white people. Elijah Muhammad states the argument
in these terms: The Caucasian race was created out
of the weak of the black race; they are the handiwork of
Yakub, a black scientist who rebelled against Allah. Dr.
Eric Lincoln is correct when he says that the doctrine of
Yakub is the central myth of the Black Muslim movement.
But it is also the tenet the Black Muslims seem to know
least about.</p>

<p>Writing in the <i>Pittsburgh Courier</i>, Elijah Muhammad
detailed in these words the mechanics by which the black
scientist Yakub made the white man:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>Who are the white race? I have repeatedly answered that
question in this [column] for nearly the past three years.
&#8220;Why are they white-skinned?&#8221; Answer: Allah (God) said
this is due to being grafted from the Original Black Nation,
as the Black Man has two germs (two people) in him.
One is black and the other brown. The brown germ is
weaker than the black germ. The brown germ can be
grafted into its last stage, and the last stage is white. A
scientist by the name of Yakub discovered this knowledge
... 6,645 years ago, and was successful in doing this job
of grafting after 600 years of following a strict and rigid
birth control law.</p></blockquote>

<p>According to Elijah Muhammad the experiment was a
success, but it also resulted in the &#8220;blue-eyed devils&#8221; who
now people the world and have low physical and moral
stamina. Muhammad then goes on to show the physical
superiority of the black man by underlining the victories
of Negro ballplayers and prize fighters. He then points up
what he calls the low morality of the white man by citing
the gas chambers of Germany, the atomic bomb of Hiroshima,
and all the abuses white Southerners (and Northerners)
have heaped upon the Negro.</p>

<p>Summing up the results of Yakub&#8217;s experiment, Elijah
Muhammad issues this finding:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The human beast&mdash;the serpent, the dragon, the devil,
and Satan&mdash;all mean one and the same: the people or race
known as the white or Caucasian race, sometimes called
the European race.</p>

<p>Since by nature they were created liars and murderers,
they are the enemies of truth and righteousness, and the
enemies of those who seek the truth....</p></blockquote>

<p>But their certification of the white man as a devil, one
incapable of doing good, rests on more than metaphysical
grounds. It involves history. To make their historical point
the Black Muslims part company with the established world<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
historians. They begin their argument by establishing&mdash;with
some accuracy&mdash;that the black man in Africa had a
developed civilization at the time that, in Malcolm&#8217;s words,
&#8220;the white savages of Europe were living in caves and
crawling around on their all-fours.&#8221; It was the intrusion of
the white man into Africa that spoiled things and brought
slavery to the New World.</p>

<p>The decline of the black man in Africa is only temporary.
The white devil was given about six thousand years to
flaunt his evil and then he was to be destroyed as the black
man returned to power. The white man&#8217;s time ran out just
as World War I was raging; the Black Muslims overcame
the fact that this was an excellent time for the prophecy
to come true&mdash;after all, white people were out to destroy
each other&mdash;with the argument that sets the American stage
for the followers of The Honorable Elijah Muhammad.</p>

<p>The only reason the destruction of the white man didn&#8217;t
come off on schedule, according to the Muslims, is that so
many black men are all mixed up with the white, that it
is impossible to destroy the evil men without destroying
some &#8220;originals,&#8221; that is to say, Negroes. This, then, is what
Muhammad and Malcolm are talking about when they
speak to &#8220;the lost-found black man in the wilderness of
North America.&#8221; They are really saying that the restoration
of black men to world power is being delayed because of
the American Negro; the white man has been given a new
dispensation, actually, not because he deserves it but to
give the Negro time to separate from those scheduled for
destruction.</p>

<p>Herein lies the reasoning behind Muhammad&#8217;s talk about
a separate state; this is why the Black Muslims with their
tremendous power over people are unable to participate in
any of the current civil-rights actions; they can&#8217;t help fight
for better jobs, better schools, or better housing. They are
committed to getting out from among the white man as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
soon as possible, lest they share his doom of the fire, which
is sure not only to come next time, but to come soon.</p>

<p>To plug up the logical and emotional leaks in such an
argument as this, the Black Muslims must propagate a continuously
expanding &#8220;line.&#8221; They must maintain the &#8220;Islamic&#8221;
tinge but at the same time keep their teaching within
American terms of reference that Negroes can understand;
they must take Negroes who have a struggle with English
and teach them Arabic; they must convince the most Western
of men that they are Arabs.</p>

<p>This cultural island-hopping can backfire, sometimes with
amusing results. I attended a Black Muslim bazaar with
writer Alex Haley. Elijah Muhammad was scheduled to
appear but sent his son, Akbar, instead. Akbar, a slender,
dark-brown twenty-five-year-old, came before the crowd
of some two thousand garbed in a flowing white sheet. In
Middle Eastern Arabic circles Akbar would have been
considered in his Sunday best, but to Harlem Negroes
Akbar&#8217;s dress smacked of the Ku Klux Klan, hardly an
image one wishes to raise in a man he hopes to convert.
Yet this is the cross-cultural problem the Black Muslims
must continually deal with.</p>

<p>I have seen Malcolm X do this with tremendous effectiveness.
I once debated with him on TV in Los Angeles.
He took the stand of a Muslim, saying that the Moslem
faith was the black man&#8217;s original culture. Malcolm must
make this basic thrust or all else he says rests on historical
sand. As we were leaving the studio, we were greeted by
several white students, Moslems from Persia, who complained
to Malcolm that they had attempted to visit Muhammad&#8217;s
temples and were refused entry because they
were white blue-eyed devils. Malcolm glossed the matter
over, and they all parted wishing Allah&#8217;s blessing each upon
the other. In reality, Malcolm is not interested in any white
people, Moslem or not. These Persians could no more get<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
in a Black Muslim temple than Governor Faubus could.
&#8220;Let&#8217;s look at it this way,&#8221; Malcolm told the Persians. &#8220;If
a lion is in a cage, his roar will be different from the roar
of the lion who is in the forest. That,&#8221; he concluded, &#8220;is
why you couldn&#8217;t get in our temple. But both the lion in the
forest and the lion in the cage are lions. That is what matters.
Lions love lions; they hate leopards.&#8221;</p>

<p>Translated, Malcolm was saying that the American
Negro, as a Moslem, must make different noises from the
free Moslems of, say, Persia, because the American Negro
is in a cage. The cage, of course, is white civilization; that
is why the roar of the American Negro Moslem is so provincial;
that is why Persians would do well to worship
Allah in their own way in their own temples, while the
Black Muslims and Allah have their rendezvous in a dinky
auditorium over a pool hall in Los Angeles&#8217; Negro ghetto.</p>

<p>It is in such meetings that Malcolm adds the historical
ingredient to his theology. It takes two forms:</p>

<p>First, the Black Muslims excite Negroes to shouts by
proving that the Negro is somebody, a man with a past and
a history. I know from personal experience that Malcolm X
is one of the best-versed people in America on African history.
I have sat with him in private and general gatherings
where he has recited startling facts about the nature of
early African civilizations. When challenged, Malcolm is
always able to produce a text&mdash;and a legitimate one at that&mdash;to
support what he says. Malcolm&#8217;s teachings come as a
surprise not because they are new, previously unknown
facts about Africa, but because the entire system of education
in the Western World, particularly in America, has
carefully distorted the true history of Africa to support the
notion of white, male supremacy. And so it is from Malcolm
X, not from his sixth-grade history teacher&mdash;who is probably
white&mdash;that the Negro child in the North learns the
truth about Africa and what once really happened there.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>The second historical aspect of the Muslim doctrine
involves an intensive study of the role of the American
Negro in American history. Here again Malcolm and his
followers walk into a void left by the American education
system. The black child in Harlem learns about the Revolutionary
War but he does not learn that the man who set it
off by leading the Americans in the Boston Massacre was
a Negro, Crispus Attucks. The black child sees the clock
work but he does not know that Benjamin Bannaker, a
Negro, invented the pendulum. The black child visits the
blood bank but he does not know that a Negro, Dr. Charles
Drew, discovered how to preserve blood and thus made
the bank possible. Nobody tells the Negro child these things
in school. On the contrary, the child is taught that American
civilization flowed, for the most part, from white
brains. And when Malcolm, to use his words, &#8220;pulls the
cover off the white devil and tells black men the truth about
the work of their ancestors,&#8221; the Negro child shrieks with
pride and joy&mdash;probably for the first time in his life.</p>

<p>Malcolm X brings his message of importance and dignity
to a class of Negroes who have had little, if any, reason to
feel proud of themselves as a race or as individuals. Their
encounters with white people are always unpleasant situations
in which Negroes find themselves embarrassed or
emasculated. Think it out for yourself: What contact does
the Negro in Harlem have with the white man?</p>

<p>The white man is the <i>man</i> they must meet every morning
when they go to work in the garment district; the <i>man</i>
they must meet when the rent is due; the <i>man</i> they face
when they go to the pawnshop; the <i>man</i> who comes and
sells things on credit; the <i>man</i> who buys the installment
paper and comes to collect the payments; the <i>man</i> who
gets work when they cannot; the <i>man</i> whom they see on
TV loosing dogs on Negro children; the <i>man</i> they face as
a schoolteacher who does not understand them and who is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
often contemptuous of them&mdash;the man, the man, the man,
the white man, the goddam white man! And when Malcolm
X says the white man is a devil, they roar &#8220;amen&#8221; because
every experience they have with a white man is a
devilish one.</p>

<p>Chilling though it may be, the Black Muslims have
erected their teaching on a group experience common to all
American Negroes. Few of us concur in their conviction
and sentencing of the white race. But none of us can question
the accuracy of the indictment on which that conviction
rests.</p>


<h4><i>Elijah Goes to Mecca</i></h4>

<p>The <i>hajj</i>, the long, dusty pilgrimage to Mecca that every
Moslem looks forward to, is the final criterion of whether
one is or is not a Moslem. Only certified followers of Islam
are allowed to enter Mecca during the holy period of the
pilgrimage.</p>

<p>&#8220;Elijah Muhammad is not a Moslem,&#8221; said Imam Talib
Ahmad Dawud in 1960. &#8220;He is just plain Elijah Poole of
Sandersville, Georgia.&#8221; Dawud, an American Negro and
leader of the Muslim Brotherhood USA, was then locked
in a bitter struggle with the Black Muslims over the question
of their religious authenticity. But the Imam&#8217;s remarks
couldn&#8217;t have been more ill-timed. Even as Dawud was
denouncing the Black Muslims, Elijah was packing his bags
for a trip &#8220;back home where I can visit and pray with my
own people.&#8221; Several days after he departed from New
York, Elijah placed his credentials before the eagle-eyed
<i>hajj</i> committee, the final judge of who may march to Mecca
and pray. Elijah Muhammad was admitted without delay,
and Black Muslims&mdash;the word was cabled back and came
over the wire services&mdash;held meetings of praise and thanks
all over the nation.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>That was that. Muhammad was admitted to the <i>hajj</i>, he
made the holy walk to Mecca. Who, then, is to dispute his
religious credentials?</p>

<p>Muhammad&#8217;s journey to Mecca brought an end to all the
arguments about his true affiliation with traditional Islam.
When Mike Wallace and I were preparing a TV documentary
on the Black Muslims, the orthodox Moslems denounced
the movement. &#8220;They teach race hate,&#8221; one
Islamic spokesman told us, &#8220;and that means they couldn&#8217;t
be Moslems.&#8221; The Federation of Islamic Associations of
Chicago is the official Moslem organization in the United
States and Canada. They have denounced Elijah; they have
praised him for conducting the largest Arabic school in
America and for accepting the Koran as law, but federation
officials are &#8220;suspicious&#8221; of him. These Moslems, however,
are largely of European descent, although their ranks
are peppered with a few Negro converts. Their rejection
of Elijah rests on his argument concerning racism, and they
flinch when Muhammad calls himself &#8220;The Messenger of
Allah.&#8221;</p>

<p>Rejection from such a group is grist for the Black Muslims&#8217;
mill. Malcolm X holds them up to high ridicule and
scorn, saying they have been corrupted by Christianity and
that they look very much like &#8220;the blue-eyed devil who enslaved
us and took away our culture.&#8221; In his &#8220;University
Speech&#8221; (see Part Two of this book) Malcolm rains fire
upon these &#8220;European Moslems&#8221; who have &#8220;passed us by
in an attempt to make our slave masters Moslems.&#8221;</p>

<p>There are several clear differences between Black Muslims
and orthodox Moslems. Whether these differences
read Elijah and his followers out of the Islamic brotherhood
is a matter to be determined by Islamic officials.
These are some of the differences between the two groups:</p>

<p>&mdash;The Black Muslims will not allow white persons in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
their temples; orthodox Moslems accept worshipers of all
races.</p>

<p>&mdash;The Black Muslims maintain a separate movement;
there seems to be little or no organizational link with the
orthodox Moslems. The Black Muslims do not visit the
orthodox Moslem temples, and the orthodox Moslems do
not come to hear Malcolm X.</p>

<p>&mdash;Nowhere in the Koran or in any orthodox Moslem literature
is there support for the Black Muslim&#8217;s teaching about
the evil scientist Yakub. Nor is there any support in the
teachings of orthodox Moslems to support Elijah&#8217;s account&mdash;see
his &#8220;Atlanta Speech&#8221; in Part Two&mdash;that this world was
once the moon and was blown up by an evil scientist who
wanted to destroy true followers of Allah.</p>

<p>&mdash;Orthodox Moslems universally condemn the Black Muslim
teaching that the white man is a devil by nature.</p>

<p>&mdash;Orthodox Moslems universally object to the Black
Muslim preachment concerning a separate state.</p>

<p>But once Muhammad walked into Mecca these differences
ceased to matter. To be sure, orthodox Moslems want
no part of Elijah and, if pushed, will denounce him. But
the <i>hajj</i> committee has rendered what must be accepted
as the final verdict.</p>

<p>Behind this trip to Mecca lies a typical Black Muslim
story. Malcolm X had visited the Near and the Far East
the year before. His mission was to make certain key contacts
for Muhammad. I followed Malcolm by some several
months into Cairo, Egypt, and talked with Moslem officials
who had received him with open arms. Malcolm was in
Cairo during the holy season, at the very time when thousands
of chanting Arabs were wending their way toward
Mecca. Malcolm himself was cleared to make the <i>hajj</i>; he
could have gone to Mecca in 1959 and that would have
settled the controversy once and for all. Malcolm elected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
not to go, not to upstage his teacher and leader. Instead he
returned home with the word that all was well in Mecca,
that Elijah and his family would be received there with
open arms.</p>

<p>The following year, while Malcolm remained at home,
Elijah went to Mecca.</p>

<p>Malcolm&#8217;s ambassadorial work in Cairo&mdash;and that is precisely
what it was&mdash;stunned many of his American detractors.
Others of us who had been close observers of the
movement were not surprised. We knew that Malcolm has
always maintained excellent relations with top Arabs at
the United Nations. Few, if any, of these meetings were
ever public. But they did occur and there is every indication
that they are still going on. The road to Mecca was
cleared long before Malcolm and Elijah left these shores;
powerful pro-Nasser Arabs are quietly in Malcolm&#8217;s corner,
and many Black Muslim bazaars open with the reading
of cabled greetings from &#8220;Our Beloved Brother Gamal
Abdel Nasser.&#8221;</p>

<p>The emphasis of orthodox Islam is universal love and
brotherhood among men of all races. The central teaching
of the Black Muslims is that all white men are devils and
will soon be destroyed. It seems superfluous to point out
the wide disparity between these two views. But both Muslim
and Moslem worship Allah. And that&mdash;at least so the
<i>hajj</i> committee said&mdash;is all that matters.</p>

<p>The answer to this ambiguity, I suspect, lies in the gangling
structure of the Moslem hierarchy. Unlike, say, the
Catholic Church, the Moslem faith is not a tightly knit,
fully administered organization. I have talked with Moslems
about all this, and while they would rather that Elijah
did not say much of what he says, they are still smarting
over the Christian Crusades and readying for the moment
of truth with the Jews. The Black Muslims carefully describe
themselves as &#8220;anti-Zionist&#8221; rather than as against the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
Jews. But herein, I suspect, is the resolution of the entire
matter of Elijah&#8217;s relationship to orthodox Islam.</p>

<p>A high Islamic official in Cairo explained it to me in
these words: &#8220;Of course your Black Muslims are improperly
informed. But they are turning men to Allah, away
from Christianity, toward Mecca. This is what we want;
this is what we must have. We need new blood in western
Islam. If Muhammad can give that new blood we welcome
him. As for his teachings,&#8221; the official continued, &#8220;we will
see to it that the correct view is given to the black man in
America. Now the thing is to get them facing toward
Mecca.&#8221;</p>


<h4><i>Is This a True Religion?</i></h4>

<p>Although Elijah has made his holy pilgrimage to Mecca,
the debate over the religious validity of the Black Muslims
still rages, with the movement&#8217;s critics holding to their
charge that Elijah Muhammad teaches hate whereas true
religion teaches love. A case can be made that these critics
are doubly in error, first in their assumption that their own
faith teaches universal love, and secondly in their conclusion&mdash;aided
by news accounts&mdash;that the Black Muslims
actually preach hatred of others.</p>

<p>Every religion is a closed network of believers; it has its
dogma, its ritual, its gods. The followers of that faith are
taught to love one another and are urged to proselytize sinners
(outsiders) wherever they can be found. Most religions
draw creedal, not racial, lines. Persons of any race
may embrace the tenets of the faith and become members.
However, this is not always the case and racial overtones
have crept into major world faiths.</p>

<p>The late, and loved, Pope John flirted with immortality
by coming to grips with the issue of racism in religion. Not
only did he infuse the Church with the fresh air of universalism,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
but he halted a service because a priest violated&mdash;forgot,
actually&mdash;His Holiness&#8217; order that a reference to
the Jews as a &#8220;perfidious people&#8221; be stricken from the
Catholic prayer service. The pending second session of the
ecumenical council may see the introduction of a proposal
that would call on the Church to speak out against anti-Semitism.
The proposal was not brought up in the first
session because the Church fathers feared what the Arabs
might say!</p>

<p>The Jews and the Protestants face essentially the same
problems as the Roman Catholics. St. Paul rose to glory
because he translated being a Jew from a biological to a
spiritual proposition. Many Jews have not accepted that
translation and they snicker when Sammy Davis, Jr., walks
into their temple. Racism is such a fact of American Protestant
church life that most major denominations are
divided along racial lines. Then there is the question of
religion and geography. The world&#8217;s major faiths were
spawned in certain areas and took root among people of a
common ethnic stock. Thus the followers of Buddha are apt
to be Orientals; but for slavery and colonization all of the
followers of Christ would be European. But for the same
kind of cultural intermingling, Allah&#8217;s followers would be
the peoples of Asia Minor and North Africa, and the black
peoples below the Sahara would still be practicing the
varied tribal and family faiths mentioned earlier in this
essay.</p>

<p>But time and trouble make saints of everybody ... and
universalism occurs only when feuding faiths clash on the
plains of practical reality. Thus American Protestants now
have a commission that is given over entirely to eliminating
all anti-Semitism from the gospel of Christ. The Episcopal
Bishop of California, James Pike, has gone so far as to suggest
that we take down the cross as a symbol of our faith
lest this encourage the teaching that the Jews killed Our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
Lord. This teaching&mdash;that the Jews killed Christ&mdash;is no
longer fashionable as it was when I was baptized. Now
one is told that the Romans killed Christ. And since the
once-heathen Romans are now Christians&mdash;even though
they are Catholics&mdash;I suppose this makes things better.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Now let&#8217;s turn to the other side of the coin.</p>

<p>During a recent lecture before the Jewish Graduate Club
at Columbia University I talked about the need for all
orthodox religions to relax their dogmas and accept other
peoples as equals. One fiercely intent man leaped to his
feet and shouted to me, &#8220;You want to rob us of our culture
because you people don&#8217;t have one of your own!&#8221;
This was sheer nonsense and the host rabbi rose to say
so. But I pressed the issue: Could I join their temple?
The younger Jews shouted &#8220;Yes&mdash;we would love to have
you.&#8221; The older fellows were not quite so sure.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you as Jews chosen of God, thus the only ones
who are really blessed?&#8221; I asked one of the fundamentalists.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he shot back.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you chosen in a way that I can never be?&#8221; I continued.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221; He faltered. &#8220;You are not a Jew; you cannot be
among the elect.&#8221;</p>

<p>By this time the younger Jews were on their feet screaming
denunciations of him. But the issue of ethnic exclusiveness
that splits today&#8217;s Jewish community had been laid
bare.</p>

<p>Dogma and ritual are further evidences of the tribalism
endemic to religion. I was born and raised a Baptist;
long before I could read and write I knew that any person
who had not been immersed in water was doomed to Hell.
There was nothing to argue about, no need for polemics
and reasoning; there would be no Methodists in Heaven!</p>

<p>The point of truth is this: Ethnic and dogmatic bigotry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
are imbedded in every religious faith plying its wares in
the world market; we religious liberals are students of
apologetics, sophisticated believers who prefer to forget
our crude and tribalistic roots in favor of an enlightened
social ethic. Alas, along came Elijah and made us see
ourselves as we once were; along came Malcolm X and
made us understand what we are now, and why.</p>

<p>The argument that the Black Muslims are not a valid
religion because of the exclusivity of their fellowship, then,
is clearly spurious. Every religion is a sort of sanctified
country club, a coming together of peers in the name of
their god. The second argument against the religiosity of
the Black Muslims is equally spurious: Like all faiths, the
Black Muslims never say hate the other fellow; they say love
your own kind. Religious bigotry is Western civilization&#8217;s
major moral blind spot, and Malcolm X has taken up squatters&#8217;
rights just there.</p>

<p>Thus it is that secularism must save the church&mdash;the layman
must lead the clergyman to the mourner&#8217;s bench and
make him confess brotherhood in the name of a democratic
and pluralistic society. The nature of our social moment
demands that we free God from racialism and dogmatics.
Racialism, the malignant one of the two cancers, must be
dealt with first since it is the prime moral issue of our
time. And it must be dealt with by all peoples of all faiths
working in concert. Should our social order change, should
we somehow come to grips with the evils that have
spawned the Black Muslims, the movement would be forced
to refine itself or perish.</p>

<p>Malcolm X is the best authority for this. I have often
pressed him on his categorical denunciation of the white
man as a devil, and his reply is always the same: &#8220;The
Honorable Elijah Muhammad teaches us that the white
man is a devil. We hold to that teaching because history
proves the white man is a devil. If he is not a devil,&#8221;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
Malcolm X concludes, &#8220;then let him prove it. Let him give
justice, freedom, and equality to our people.&#8221;</p>

<p>I have deliberately kept my analysis of the Black Muslims
in personal terms of reference because this is precisely how
most Negroes feel about the matter&mdash;after all, the attraction
of the movement for Negroes is one of the major points
of this essay.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course I disagree with Malcolm,&#8221; the wife of a
Negro newsman told me. &#8220;But I disagree with a lot of
other religions, too. If he teaches hate, so do they; what&#8217;s
the difference? I wonder why the white people are after
him.&#8221; She smiled. &#8220;Could it be because he is colored?&#8221;</p>

<p>The Black Muslims have their God, their gospel, their
ritual trappings, their approval from official heads of the
Islamic faith. As a religion, then, there is little left to do
but disagree with them and then leave them alone.</p>

<p>This, of course, pains liberals, Negro and white, who
want to hear a ringing denunciation of the Black Muslims.
Negro leaders are always quick to denounce Elijah, but
the Negro masses are strangely silent. There is a reason
for this silence, something both the Negro leadership and
the white power structure would do well to examine:
Deep down in their hearts, as James Baldwin so accurately
states, the black masses don&#8217;t believe in white people any
more. They don&#8217;t believe in Malcolm either, except when
he articulates their disbelief in white people. In the end&mdash;and
this is the thing white people will be a long time
in grasping&mdash;the Negro masses neither join nor denounce
the Black Muslims. They just sit at home in the ghetto
amid the heat, the roaches, the rats, the vice, the disgrace,
and rue the fact that come daylight they must meet the
man&mdash;the white man&mdash;and work at a job that leads only
to a dead end.</p>

<p>This brings me to the core of the matter, to the final
measure of every religion: it is a thing called <i>compassion</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
a concern and caring about the other fellow. It is rooted
in the glaring awareness that we all have fallen short of
the high mark set for us, and thus we need the honest
sympathy and understanding of all men everywhere.</p>

<p>For though you may have your God, your holy book,
your ritual, and your symbols; though you may give of
your wages to build the temple; and though you may have
been to Mecca, or Jerusalem, if you have not compassion
you are but meanness couched in Scripture, you are but an
ancient stink, a reason for men to hold their noses as they
crawl on toward a land of human understanding and
brotherhood.</p>


<h4><i>The Nation</i></h4>

<p>Once the convert becomes a Black Muslim he is baptized
as a citizen in the Nation of Islam. They have a flag, a
symbol, and a cause. From this day forward his life centers
around activity at the Muslim restaurant and temple.</p>

<p>Who are these Black Muslims? Where do they live, and
what do they do for a living?</p>

<p>These questions baffle all observers because any Negro
you encounter could be a Black Muslim. Usually the men
wear identifying pins, and the Muslim women can generally
be spotted by their dress, particularly the long,
flowing headpiece. But these identifying signs are not always
present. I have encountered Black Muslims working
in printing plants, in barbershops, as messenger boys, as
night-club entertainers, and as cab drivers. I will never
forget taking a stroll in Central Park where I came across
a Muslim sister working as a nursemaid to three white
children! Since most nurses and maids are Negroes, the
rise of the Black Muslims has sent a quiet but very real
chill through the employment agencies in several major
cities. After all, there is no telling what these Muslim<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
women will do when the &#8220;word&#8221; comes, when the Battle
of Armageddon is declared. And there is no way for employment
agencies to determine if Negro applicants are
Black Muslims before sending them out as servants in
white homes. Nor is there any way for heads of households
to know just who their butlers and cooks are. To borrow
from James Baldwin, nobody knows their name. It could
be &#8220;X.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Black Muslims flatly refuse to discuss their organizational
finances with anyone. However, observers of
the movement are convinced that the tithes collected at
temples and the income from temple restaurants form the
basis of the Muslim economy. The local restaurant&mdash;and
most of them are called &#8220;Shabazz&#8221; restaurants after Malcolm
X whose &#8220;restored&#8221; Arab name is Shabazz&mdash;is under
the supervision of the local minister. He seems to have
fairly complete control, but all matters are subject to
review by Malcolm X as Elijah&#8217;s roving ambassador. The
local ministers are allowed a certain portion of what they
raise, but only top insiders know just how Mr. Muhammad
makes this determination. The major leaders of the movement
all seem to have taken a vow of poverty and live on
expenses furnished by the movement itself. I know this
is true of Malcolm X and I suspect it to be true of
others.</p>

<p>But it must be remembered that the Black Muslims are
both thrifty and industrious; they are encouraged to open
their own businesses and many of the top leaders are themselves
businessmen. Elijah Muhammad, Jr., runs one of
the largest bakeries in Chicago; Raymond Sharrieff is said
to have ownership in a clothing store there. All evidence
indicates that local Muslim leaders finance themselves
through various enterprises and that the bulk of the funds
raised in the temple itself flow on to the movement headquarters
in Chicago.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>Whoever and wherever these Black Muslims are they
lead an exacting, regimented life. In their homes they
practice strict dietary laws&mdash;precisely those of the kosher
Jews&mdash;and avoid contact with white people as much as
possible. The private role of both the man and the woman
in the family is clearly defined, and the children are indoctrinated
with the faith while they are still young.
Muslim men are watched by The Fruit and must engage in
some kind of gainful employment. They are encouraged to
go into small business whenever possible; they are assured
of patronage from their fellow Muslims. A number of Negro
businessmen have been attracted to the Nation of Islam because
it provides them with a ready source of customers.
Other Muslim brothers can be seen on the streets every
day selling Muslim newspapers. They are allowed to keep
a goodly portion of what they earn and are thus independent.
The temple restaurants employ scores of Muslim
men and women, thus decreasing the ranks of their unemployed.
Other Muslims are door-to-door salesmen and
find easy entry in the Negro community, where the white
door-to-door salesmen have become anathema.</p>

<p>But the average Black Muslim works for some white man
somewhere in some capacity. He is urged to learn a trade
and thus ready himself for the day when he will be called
upon to be one of the heads of industry and commerce in
the Muslims&#8217; own, separate state.</p>

<p>The Black Muslim men are lectured constantly about
family responsibility and are subject to trial before their
peers if they violate the rules of the order. Punishment can
vary from a small fine to temporary or permanent banishment
from the temple. No Muslim will associate with an
offender for the duration of his exile. It is said that Malcolm
X&#8217;s brother was once banished and that Malcolm
refused even to write the man until the period of punishment
had been served.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>Black Muslim women are schooled in the art and need
for homemaking, and are taught to take a back seat in the
presence of their husbands. Muslim women almost never
talk to strangers&mdash;non-Muslims, that is&mdash;and maintain a
general silence that is unnerving. They also eschew make-up
and fancy dress. When I first encountered the Muslims
some five years ago, this ban on feminine adornment was
rigidly enforced. But there seems to have been a strong
revolt among temple women and the ban has been relaxed
to the point where employing make-up is now optional.
Yet I have seen few Muslim women exercise this option.
The wife of a major Muslim official, say Joseph X of New
York, certainly wouldn&#8217;t exercise it.</p>

<p>The Black Muslims are a male-oriented organization. A
man reaches real stature in the movement when he becomes
a member of The Fruit of Islam, the functional and
disciplinary arm of the movement. The Fruit hold separate
temple services, where they are taught, among other things,
every possible method of self-defense. Every local temple
has a Captain of The Fruit&mdash;in New York it is Joseph X&mdash;and
the entire network is headed by the son-in-law of
Elijah Muhammad, Raymond Sharrieff. The Fruit enforce
brotherhood among the men of the temple and form the
honor guard whenever Malcolm X or Elijah Muhammad
makes a public appearance. The Fruit work under the
local minister, but there is a line of authority that runs
down to the local captains directly from Sharrieff&#8217;s Chicago
headquarters. The Muslim Girls Training Class
(MGT), for young women, is headed by Sister Lottie X,
also of Chicago.</p>

<p>The division of authority seems to be along these lines:
The local Fruit and MGT work under the local minister
on local matters. But unless the matter in question is one
of clearly defined doctrine the local minister gets clearance
from Chicago before issuing his orders. On national matters,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
those affecting the movement as a whole, The Fruit
and the MGT take orders directly from headquarters.
These orders are issued to members of the temple who
obey without question.</p>

<p>One of the functions of The Fruit and the MGT is fund-raising.
None of the rumors about Muslims receiving help
from outside&mdash;Communist or segregationist&mdash;sources has
proved true. The fact of the matter is that the Black Muslims
are hard-working, frugal people; they never buy on
installment, and they give a tenth&mdash;at least&mdash;of their earnings
to the temple. This income is augmented by bazaars,
plays, rallies, and the sale of their own newspapers and
magazines. Then there is the matter of the various lawsuits
the Muslims have carried on with astonishing success.
The Black Muslims have collected upward of a quarter of
a million dollars I know about in the past four years or so,
mostly as a result of police brutality against their members.
These suits are filed in the name of the individual
Muslim but they are carried on by the temple, and I
suspect the temple shares in the results.</p>

<p>Further regimentation of life within the Nation is
achieved by demanding that members send their children
to Black Muslim schools wherever possible. In two cities,
Chicago and Detroit, the Muslims have &#8220;universities&#8221; where
they train the children from kindergarten through high
school. It will be recalled that Elijah Muhammad first got
into trouble with the law when he decided to send his
children to the Muslim school rather than the public
schools. Now authorities in both cities have approved the
Muslim schools as accredited centers of learning.</p>

<p>These schools are well disciplined and skillfully run.
Early in 1962 there was considerable concern in Chicago
over just what the Black Muslims were teaching in their
schools. A biracial committee visited the University of
Islam there and came away stunned. Said committee member<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
Judge Edyth Sampson, a former U.S. delegate to the
United Nations, &#8220;These people are doing a magnificent job
with their young students. I am deeply impressed by what
I saw.&#8221;</p>

<p>What Mrs. Sampson and her fellow committee members
saw was essentially this: Black Muslim boys and girls stand
muster for cleanliness and decorum each morning. The
classes are separated, boys in one section, girls in the
other, and the students&#8217; day is divided between religious
and secular education. They are taught both English and
Arabic; they are drilled in the history of the black man in
Africa and America. Then they are taught the history of
the Black Muslim movement from Fard down to Minister
Malcolm X.</p>

<p>In 1963 Sister Christine X, one of the directors of the
school, authored a new first reader which is now being
employed. The exercises in the book are something American
educators would do well to study:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>My name is Nora X. My father&#8217;s name is James X, and
my mother is Frances X. We are Muslims. We have our
own flag. Our flag is over there on the wall. The symbols on
our flag are a star and a crescent.</p></blockquote>

<p>Then the students are told to use the following words
in sentences: Allah, black, Muhammad, God, Temple, nation,
flag, Armageddon, Elijah.</p>

<p>Other exercises in the book call for the student to write
short essays on Mr. Muhammad and other notables within
the movement. Then as the students progress through school
they are taught to link subject matter to the history of the
black man. For example, when the students are being
taught mathematics they are repeatedly reminded that
much of modern math is based on work done by the
Egyptians; they are not allowed to forget that English
is not their native tongue, that their language is Arabic,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
that the white man robbed them of their tongue when he
kidnaped their foreparents from Africa.</p>

<p>The thing that arrests me most about these schools is
that they are now turning out the first generation of youth
completely schooled in the Black Muslim doctrine. Unlike
Malcolm X, John Ali, and other prominent Muslims of
today who had to be &#8220;de-brainwashed&#8221; before they saw
the light, the movement now has several score teen-agers
who have been grounded in their faith just as a devout
Catholic child is reared in his. As of now the movement
suffers greatly from a lack of trained leaders. Only a handful
of capable men and women are available to the organization
and the nature of their doctrine is such that
trained Negroes are hardly apt to join. But a few more
years will see the emergence of well-trained Black Muslims
who, I am certain, will give the organization more administrative
order than it now has.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the Black Muslims are bombarding Negroes
all over the nation with their message to the &#8220;lost-found,
so-called Negro in the wilderness of North America.&#8221; For
a number of years Mr. Muhammad had a weekly column
in some of the nation&#8217;s best Negro newspapers. Now the
Muslims publish their own weekly, <i>Mr. Muhammad Speaks</i>,
a thirty-six-page tabloid that has the largest circulation of
any Negro newspaper being published. The Muslims also
conduct a weekly radio program on stations in some forty
cities throughout the nation. All this is augmented by the
appearances of Malcolm X on radio and TV programs
each week. All in all, the Black Muslims have covered the
nation; their basic teachings are known and debated by
Negroes everywhere.</p>

<p>On the whole, then, the state of the Nation of Islam is
good; its population is growing, its economy is well into
the black, and its foreign relations&mdash;though strained&mdash;are
better than they have ever been before.</p>

4. THE BLACK MUSLIMS AND<br />
THE NEGRO REVOLT</h3></div>


<h4><i>The Separate State</i></h4>

<p><span class="smcap">On the day</span> every television network carried scenes of
Birmingham police dogs attacking Negro children, Malcolm
X submitted to an interview. Asked what he thought
of the events at Birmingham, Malcolm said: &#8220;Martin Luther
King is a chump, not a champ. Any man who puts his
women and children on the front lines is a chump, not a
champ.&#8221;</p>

<p>This was Malcolm&#8217;s most inglorious hour. It will take
him months of hard work to regain the ground he lost
among non-Muslim Negroes with that single statement.
Even the Negro moderates, those who disapprove of the
direct-action technique, were silenced by the dogs, fire
hoses, and club-swinging policemen. Since Birmingham
I have been on a lecture tour that carried me to eight
major cities in as many states; I found that Negroes were
melted into one by the fire of that battle; I saw a unity
I have never seen in rank-and-file Negroes before; I felt
a mutual love that is all but unknown among Negroes; I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
sensed a dislike for white people that borders on the
disgraceful. Martin King&mdash;and we know his strengths as
well as his weaknesses&mdash;triggered Birmingham. This nation&#8217;s
Negroes were with him. If he was a &#8220;chump,&#8221; so
were we all.</p>

<p>Malcolm&#8217;s statement had the effect of making every
Negro who wept when he saw dogs attacking Negro children
feel like a moral idiot; Malcolm&#8217;s analysis&mdash;if proper&mdash;means
that every Negro woman who shouted resentment
when she saw her black sisters knocked to the ground is
spiritually illiterate and intellectually stupid. Malcolm&mdash;in
a contorted way, to be sure&mdash;allowed himself to become
one with Bull Conner. Malcolm X, the brilliant student of
mass psychology, blundered badly.</p>

<p>The Black Muslims had a multiple choice at Birmingham:
They could have joined us in the demonstrations;
they could have kept quiet; they could have denounced us.
I was there and watched the Black Muslim position take
shape. Minister James X of the Birmingham temple wanted
Malcolm to come and make a major speech during the
turmoil; Minister Jeremiah X, minister to the Atlanta temple
and roving southern bishop for the movement, was
of much the same mind. Knowing the Black Muslim line
of authority as I do, I am certain that James and Jeremiah
reflected not only Malcolm&#8217;s desire to come but Elijah
Muhammad&#8217;s decision to let the Big X fly to Birmingham
if the proper stage were set. The matter was debated by
Negro non-Muslims who could have set just such a stage.
Some felt it would be a good thing to have Malcolm speak
in Birmingham, since the Klan held a rally there at the
peak of the crisis. Others felt the Black Muslims should
stay out of the picture. There was a standoff on the question,
and silence prevailed. Non-Muslim Negroes knew
Malcolm X could not speak in favor of integration. And
they prayed&mdash;both to Jehovah and Allah&mdash;that Big Red<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
would take advantage of that excellent opportunity to keep
quiet.</p>

<p>Malcolm elected to speak against us. We were all pained
by his outburst, but now&mdash;after several weeks of reflection&mdash;it
is clear that Malcolm did precisely what he had to
do. For the Negro revolt had caught up with the Black
Muslims.</p>

<p>The Black Muslims came to power during a moral interregnum,
at a time when it seemed certain that this
nation would refuse to obey its own desegregation laws.
But the sudden new militancy of the Negro has forced an
unscheduled confrontation between the Muslims and this
republic: America must prove that it is not a nation of
white devils or perish. The Black Muslims, on the other
hand, must face the reality of change in the American way
of life. The Negro has always privately talked loud and
bitterly about the American white man. The Black Muslims
brought that talk into the open, on television and radio,
and made it plain for all to see and hear. This was good
for both the Negro and the white man: it shocked and
frightened white people to hear what we have been thinking
and saying about them for five hundred years; the
Black Muslims were a catharsis for us, purging our innards
of the bile brought on by slavery and segregation. Released
from consuming anger we dropped the façade of puritan
legalism and went racing into the streets screaming that
defiance which is endemic to the tribe of restless natives
we American Negroes most certainly are. Thus the inspired
Negro students who took our fight into the streets, who
shouted &#8220;now or never,&#8221; have challenged the Black Muslims
by interposing the theology of desegregation. In <i>The Negro
Revolt</i> I described that theology in these words:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The sit-ins raged throughout the spring of 1960 and
convinced even more people that direct mass action was
the shorter, more effective route to their goal of desegregation.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
But, from an internal viewpoint, more significant than
the stale coffee and soggy hamburgers was the brand of
Negro that was emerging. They were no longer afraid;
their boldness, at times, was nothing short of alarming. And
although few people knew it, a new religion, peculiar to
the Negro, was being born.</p>

<p>This faith, given incipient articulation by Martin Luther
King, was the culmination of a hundred years of folk suffering.
Like all faiths, it is peculiar to the people who fashioned
it; it was a hodgepodge, as every faith is, of every ethical
principle absorbed by my people from other cultures. And
so the best of Confucius, Moses, Jesus, Gandhi, and Thoreau
was extracted, then mixed with the peculiar experience of
the Negro in America. The result was a faith that justified
the bus boycott and inspired Negro college students to
make a moral crusade out of their right to sit down in a
restaurant owned by a white man and eat a hamburger.</p>

<p>As Pastor Kelly Miller Smith walked to the lectern to
begin his Sunday sermon, on that first Sunday of March,
1960, in Nashville, Tennessee, he knew his parishioners
wanted and needed more than just another spiritual message.
The congregation&mdash;most of them middle-class Americans,
many of them university students and faculty members&mdash;sat
before him waiting, tense; for Nashville, like some
thirty-odd other Southern college towns, was taut with
racial tension in the wake of widespread student demonstrations
against lunch counter discrimination in department
stores.</p>

<p>Among the worshipers in Pastor Smith&#8217;s First Baptist
Church were some of the eighty-five students from Fisk
and from Tennessee Agricultural and Industrial University
who had been arrested and charged with conspiracy to
obstruct trade and commerce because they staged protests
in several of Nashville&#8217;s segregated eating places. Just two
days before, Nashville police had invaded Mr. Smith&#8217;s
church&mdash;which also served as headquarters for the demonstrators&mdash;and
arrested one of their number, James Lawson,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
Jr., a Negro senior theological student at predominantly
white Vanderbilt University, on the same charge.</p>

<p>&#8220;Father, forgive them,&#8221; Mr. Smith began, &#8220;for they know
not what they do.&#8221; And for the next half-hour, the crucifixion
of Christ carried this meaning as he spoke:</p>

<p>&#8220;The students sat at the lunch counters alone to eat, and
when refused service, to wait and pray. And as they sat
there on that Southern Mount of Olives, the Roman soldiers,
garbed in the uniforms of Nashville policemen and wielding
night sticks, came and led the praying children away. As
they walked down the streets, through a red light, and
toward Golgotha, the segregationist mob shouted jeers,
pushed and shoved them, and spat in their faces, but the
suffering students never said a mumbling word. Once the
martyr mounts the Cross, wears the crown of thorns, and
feels the pierce of the sword in his side there is no turning
back.</p>

<p>&#8220;And there is no turning back for those who follow in the
martyr&#8217;s steps,&#8221; the minister continued. &#8220;All we can do is
to hold fast to what we believe, suffer what we must suffer
if we would forgive them, for they know not what they do.&#8221;</p>

<p>This new gospel of the American Negro is rooted in the
theology of desegregation; its missionaries are several thousand
Negro students who&mdash;like Paul, Silas, and Peter of the
early Christian era&mdash;are braving great dangers and employing
new techniques to spread the faith. It is not an easy
faith, for it names the conservative Negro leadership class
as sinners along with the segregationists. Yet this new
gospel is being preached by clergymen and laymen alike
wherever Negroes gather.</p></blockquote>

<p>Here, then&mdash;in the American Negro&#8217;s mind and for his
loyalty&mdash;is being waged one of the several battles gods
have fought during the history of man. This particular
encounter is between a home-grown Allah who is one with
black men the world over, but who has a special yen for
the American Negro, and a transmuted Jesus who was born<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
in Judea, crucified on Golgotha&#8217;s heights, rose from the
dead to ascend into heaven, but submitted to reincarnation
as a student sit-in. And so it is that Allah and Jesus
fight it out for the spiritual allegiance of the American
Negro at a lunch counter in Woolworth&#8217;s.</p>

<p>This is indeed a long way from the mountains near
Olympia and the flats of Greece where the gods once
romped and fought for glory. But gods follow man;
wherever man is, wherever the great issues of man are
being determined, there also one will find the gods. Man
and the issue are now centered around the rise and
current crisis of Western civilization. The British historian-theologian
Arnold Toynbee suggests that the black Westerner
may well determine the fate of Atlantic civilization.
The gods apparently agree, and they have come to our
shores to ply their wares. But Western man, particularly
the Negro, is demanding more of his gods than man once
did.</p>

<p>Once upon a time all god had to do was promise man
life after death, an eternal remission for the sins man committed
on earth while trying to sing a hymn in a strange
land. But the gods can no longer get away with such
shoddy realism; men want to eat good food, sleep without
being awakened by nibbling rats, work at jobs commensurate
with their abilities, live where their earning power
allows them, and use all facilities paid for out of public
funds.</p>

<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t want to eat a hot dog in this store,&#8221; Jeremiah
X said to me as we watched scores of Birmingham youngsters
stage sit-ins; &#8220;we want the store and the ground on
which it sits.&#8221;</p>

<p>This is the dilemma the Black Muslims now face: They
must eschew everything tinged by &#8220;integration,&#8221; yet they
must seek acceptance among the black masses who are
risking their all&mdash;particularly in the South&mdash;for the sake<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
of fuller involvement in the American mainstream. The
Muslims&#8217; reply, of course, is the separate state, a place
where all American black men will live, have their own
government, readopt Arabic, reaccept Allah, and ready
themselves for the hour when the &#8220;word&#8221; will be given and
Armageddon will proceed.</p>

<p>The tragedy of this is that Black Muslim leaders, including
Elijah Muhammad, have said they know such a
state will never come into being. This admission by them
relieves me of the need to discuss the impracticality of
the proposal. Rather, I am engaged by the fact that the
Black Muslims continue to urge Negroes to back the
demands for such a state rather than act to better their
plight in the nation as it now is.</p>

<p>Their promise of a separate state, like the chariot that
was scheduled to swing low and take us home a century
ago, is but another of the mirages that has kept the American
Negro from digging water in the land that is his and
under his feet. Black Muslims are forbidden to vote; thus
they cannot help us overcome such men as Eastland and
Talmadge. They are against all forms of integration; thus
they cannot help us in the fight for better jobs, schools, and
housing.</p>

<p>The Negro masses are beginning to indict the Black
Muslims for impotence; they talk but cannot act; they
criticize but cannot correct. Thus the Black Muslims are
running the risk of becoming just another sect, an offbeat
faith that expiates destiny by the shouting of voices, the
stomping of feet, and the banging of tambourines. Their
early promise of becoming a meaningful new faith has
been made pallid by their lack of an activated social gospel.
To put it bluntly, the Black Muslims are flirting with the
same doom that overtook Christianity.</p>

<p>As the interview in Part Two shows, I have questioned
Malcolm X in depth about this. He is adamant, his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
voice has the ring of finality. In substance, his position is
this:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The Negro Revolt will fail because integration will not
work; it will not work because the white man is wicked by
nature and will not give Negroes full participation in
American life. It is not that the white man refuses to integrate,
but that his wicked nature makes it impossible
for him to give justice, equality, and freedom to other
peoples. Even the victories that have been won are tricks,
token integration offered to a few Negroes to quiet the
Negro masses. When Negroes realize they have been
tricked, that the white man has no intentions of integrating,
trouble will break out. And this is when the Black Muslims
will inherit the earth, particularly America. This nation
could avoid all this by granting Negroes states of their
own. But they are too wicked to do even that. So let
Armageddon rip.</p></blockquote>

<p>Even so, I pressed Malcolm:</p>

<blockquote>

<p><small>LOMAX</small>: Minister Malcolm, will the Black Muslims join
picket lines and demonstrations for better jobs, housing,
and schools?</p>

<p><small>MALCOLM X</small>: Only The Honorable Elijah Muhammad can
answer that.</p></blockquote>


<h4><i>The Friends and Followers of Malcolm X</i></h4>

<p>It pains Malcolm X that most people consider him <i>the</i>
spokesman for the Black Muslims. Malcolm prefaces all
his public statements with the phrase, &#8220;The Honorable
Elijah Muhammad teaches us that ...&#8221;; he attributes his
every thought and action to the teachings of Mr. Muhammad.
&#8220;The Messenger is the Prophet of Allah,&#8221; Malcolm
once explained to me, &#8220;and I am but Elijah&#8217;s servant.&#8221;</p>

<p>Following a Los Angeles TV debate between Malcolm
X, two other Negroes, and me, my aunt invited some fifty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
people to meet the members of the panel at her home.
Malcolm X appeared and of course became the center
of attraction. The guests were upper-middle-class Negroes&mdash;doctors,
lawyers, teachers, professionals all. Some ten
white persons were also present. One woman asked Malcolm
why he prefaced his remarks by saying, &#8220;The Honorable
Elijah Muhammad teaches us that....&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Because,&#8221; Malcolm said cuttingly, &#8220;Mr. Muhammad is
everything and I am nothing. When you hear Charlie
McCarthy speak, you listen and marvel at what he says.
What you forget is that Charlie is nothing but a dummy&mdash;he
is a hunk of wood sitting on Edgar Bergen&#8217;s lap. If
Bergen quits talking, McCarthy is struck dumb; if Bergen
turns loose, McCarthy will fall to the floor, a plank of
sawdust fit for nothing but the fire. This is the way it is
with the Messenger and me. It is my mouth working, but
the voice is his.&#8221;</p>

<p>Malcolm X may well be Elijah Muhammad&#8217;s Charlie
McCarthy, but it was Charlie McCarthy who made Edgar
Bergen rich and famous. By the same token, observers are
convinced that whereas Elijah Muhammad is the maximum
leader of the movement, Malcolm X is the man who will
have to save the Black Muslims from becoming just another
sect or cult. Malcolm&#8217;s role rests on more than his indisputable
ability and public presence; it is augmented by the absence
of other talented men in the movement. I have met
and talked with every major figure in the Black Muslim
hierarchy, and there is not one among them who can do the
job that must be done if the organization is to make a
continuing impression on non-Muslim Negroes. This is
not to say that there are no able administrators within the
movement; on the contrary, I, for one, am convinced that
Malcolm is not a good administrator, that men like John
X are better suited than he for this role. But John X
cannot capture the mind and imagination of TV viewers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
as Malcolm X has done. Both of Muhammad&#8217;s sons are
extremely able, but they cannot cause the nation&#8217;s press
to beat a path to Muhammad&#8217;s door, as Malcolm has done.</p>

<p>Malcolm X now holds down three jobs: he is minister
of Temple Number Seven, New York; minister of Temple
Number Four, Washington, D.C.; and traveling bishop-trouble
shooter for the entire movement. Malcolm roams
the nation holding press conferences and being the <i>official
presence</i> wherever Muslims get into trouble with the
police; he moves between temples, making sure that internal
problems are handled correctly; he moves from
town to town organizing new temples and addressing mass
rallies; he has spoken at most major universities outside
the South and fills the air waves with his beguiling jargon.</p>

<p>Then Malcolm commutes several times a month to
Phoenix, Arizona, where the asthma-stricken Elijah Muhammad
now lives, for further guidance and policy conferences.
Hardly a day passes that Malcolm does not speak
with the Messenger from wherever he is by telephone. I
know from many personal experiences that even so trivial
a request as one for Malcolm to sit for an interview is
cleared with The Honorable Elijah Muhammad. I also
know that Muhammad sometimes says &#8220;no&#8221; and that Malcolm
obeys. Many commentators make much over what
they call the &#8220;New York-Chicago&#8221; cleavage within the
Black Muslim movement. I am inclined to doubt the
reality of that cleavage, but I am also convinced that there
are stresses and strains within the movement, the same
kinds of stresses and strains that afflict any organization
that involves human beings.</p>

<p>Elijah Muhammad officially lives in Chicago but actually
spends almost all of his time in Arizona. This is for
reasons of health alone and talk to the contrary is untrue.
From Phoenix the Messenger runs everything. Chicago is
the nerve center of the movement, and Elijah activates it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
by telephone calls and couriers. It is now clear that Elijah
has delegated to Chicago the responsibility for turning out
the movement&#8217;s publications and over-all policy statements.
It is equally clear that the finances and other administrative
chores of the movement are carried out in Chicago. Malcolm
at one time carried some of these responsibilities,
particularly the publishing of the Muslim newspaper,
and many observers thought they saw an intraorganizational
fight when these responsibilities were taken from him and
given to Chicago. They are wrong; what they saw was a
freeing of Malcolm X, a decision by Muhammad that Malcolm
was needed as ambassador-at-large for the Black
Muslims, that he should not be tied down to the responsibility
of editing and publishing a weekly newspaper. This
decision by Muhammad was made possible because John
X, a former FBI agent and perhaps the best administrative
brain in the movement, was shifted from New York to
Chicago.</p>

<p>Raymond Sharrieff is without doubt the strong man of
the movement. He is tall, big, and quiet, as a strong man
should be. But his strength, too, flows down from that
enigmatic man, Elijah Muhammad. Muhammad has been
able to harness Malcolm X, John X, and Sharrieff to the
same plow and make them pull in tandem. But once
Muhammad dies&mdash;at least, so most observers feel&mdash;this triumvirate
will fly apart and wreck the movement. I doubt
it. The Black Muslims know the world is waiting for just
this to happen, and I am positive they have already made
certain that it will not happen.</p>


<h4><i>The New Policy</i></h4>

<p>Succession is not the major question facing the Black
Muslims; the young, thinking men in the hierarchy know
what the big issue is, know that they must issue a new<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
policy statement if they are to capture the minds of the
Negroes who are carrying out the current revolution. Calling
the white man a devil and exhorting all Negroes to
prepare for life in a separate state simply is not enough
to win over the children who marched at Birmingham and
all over this republic. No, if the Black Muslims are to get
a hearing, they must have more than this to say.</p>

<p>This new policy statement is the prime concern of the
Black Muslim movement. Several factors are involved:</p>

<p>First, the consensus among the Black Muslim hierarchy
is that the current Negro demonstrations will end in bitter
defeat and disappointment. These men, including Elijah
Muhammad, are unalterably convinced that white America
will not honor the promise of integration. Then, at least
so the thinking goes, the Negro people will set off trouble;
they will denounce and abandon Martin Luther King, Roy
Wilkins, and James Farmer; they will turn for leadership
to someone who foresaw the defeat clearly. In the meantime,
however, good but misguided Negroes will take to
the streets and demonstrate because they still have faith
in integration, they still believe in the ability of white
people to do the right thing.</p>

<p>I predict the Black Muslims will erect a policy of <i>active
wait-and-see</i>; they will not join picket lines and participate
in demonstrations, but they will take a more active part
in general community life. This, I think, is the meaning
behind the recent announcement that the Black Muslims
are considering active participation in politics. The suggestion
was made during the movement&#8217;s annual convention
in Chicago early in the spring of 1963. It is still not
clear just what the Muslims have in mind, but I see them
first moving to register their people and then supporting
Negro candidates who share some of the Muslims&#8217; concerns.</p>

<p>These candidates will not be Black Muslims; they will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
be &#8220;race&#8221; men who are willing to &#8220;speak out,&#8221; an act that
is so dear to the hearts of Muslims. These Negro candidates
will not back such Muslim programs as the quest
for an all-black state, but neither will they denounce the
Black Muslims. Some Black Muslims may run for office,
however. Malcolm X has often flirted with the idea of
seeking a Congressional seat, and there are those, including
me, who feel he would win if he selected the right area.</p>

<p>This would mean that the Black Muslims would work
with political candidates who must also work with other
groups, some of whom would support direct action. This
would indirectly ally the Muslims with direct action and
would improve their image, provided they accompanied
such action with the cessation of attacks on men like Martin
Luther King and Roy Wilkins. As I see it, this is the best
possible position for the Black Muslims: it would ally them
with the Negro push for better housing, jobs, and schools
while at the same time allowing them to abstain from direct
action; it would also free them to say that a separate state
is still <i>the best</i> answer. Most of all, such a move would lift
the Black Muslims to the level of respectability they have
so long wanted. Other Negro spokesmen would have to
practice summitry with the Muslims, and they would become
an accepted rather than feared force in the Negro
community.</p>

<p>A second factor involved in the Black Muslim search for
a new policy turns on Akbar Muhammad, the youngest son
of Elijah, who has just returned to America after two years
of study at Egypt&#8217;s famed Al-Azhar University. Al-Azhar
is the cultural center of orthodox Islam, and its professors
are the brains of that faith. It is beyond question that
Elijah&#8217;s position has been enhanced by Akbar&#8217;s period of
study there; it is just as certain that the Black Muslim
movement will be affected by Akbar&#8217;s return.</p>

<p>At this writing Akbar has been home less than a month.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
He is in the company of Malcolm X and will make a nation-wide
tour of Muhammad&#8217;s temples, where he will
lecture on traditional Islam and the influence of Africa in
current world affairs.</p>

<p>Already his influence is being felt.</p>

<p>&#8220;Akbar Comes to Harlem&#8221; was the billing for a major
Black Muslim rally held shortly after his return. The New
York press, Negro and white, was filled with ads and
special announcements inviting people to come out and
hear Akbar Muhammad, the youngest son of Elijah Muhammad,
report on his sojourn and studies in Africa and Egypt.
Much was made of the fact that Akbar had been a student
at Al-Azhar University. Even more was made of the fact
that he had attended the recent summit meeting of African
heads of state as a correspondent for the Muslim newspaper,
<i>Mr. Muhammad Speaks</i>.</p>

<p>Observers of the movement were certain that his speech
would be heavily pro-African, that he would argue for a
closer relationship between the Black Muslim movement
and traditional Islam, and that he once again would remind
American Negroes of their African heritage. But
Akbar Muhammad&#8217;s two-hour talk before some four thousand
Negroes on that Saturday afternoon in Harlem proved
to be a complete surprise; further, it laid bare the only
real schism there is within the Black Muslim movement.</p>

<p>After a highly charged introduction by Malcolm X the
distinguished speaker rose. Twenty-five-year-old Akbar
Muhammad is much like his father, medium brown, diminutive,
slightly built. He stood at the lectern stroking his
goatee during the three-minute ovation from the crowd.
Then he spoke: &#8220;<i>As-Salaam-Alaikum</i>.&#8221; His Arabic was exquisite.
His inflection alone was enough to let the black
masses know they were hearing something different from
the southern-accented &#8220;Peace be with you&#8221; they hear from
the ordinary Black Muslims. All up and down the block<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
Muslims leaped into the air with ecstasy, praising Allah
for the &#8220;back home&#8221; diction one of their leaders had acquired.</p>

<p>Akbar had been speaking a scant five minutes when the
crowd became strangely silent. Elijah&#8217;s son was clearly
giving a new teaching, a gospel that contradicted much of
what Malcolm X and others had been saying for the past
few years.</p>

<p>&#8220;We must have unity among Negroes,&#8221; Akbar said.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>It is time for all of us&mdash;CORE, the NAACP, Dr. Martin
Luther King, the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee,
and the Black Muslims&mdash;to sit down together behind
closed doors and unite. Negro leaders must now stop
calling each other names. We must stop calling Dr. King
names, and he must stop talking about us before the enemy.
We may not be able to walk all the way to freedom together,
but we can walk half the way together, so let&#8217;s
unite and walk together as far as we can.</p></blockquote>

<p>The audience began to warm to his strange message.
The notion of unity among Negro leaders&mdash;including the
Muslims&mdash;was not new. Malcolm X had launched the same
theme three years ago but found no takers among established
Negro leaders. Recently, however, the breach had
widened; Malcolm called Martin Luther King &#8220;a chump,
not a champ&#8221;; King took to a New York pulpit and denounced
&#8220;those among us who would have us live in a
separate state.&#8221; The night of that sermon King was pelted
with eggs as he entered the church. Malcolm X denied
that the Black Muslims were responsible for the incident
but he also refused to say he was sorry that it had happened.
All this was less than two weeks before the speech
by Akbar.</p>

<p>I watched the setting as Akbar continued to speak. The
stage obviously had been readied for him. This was no
ordinary rally: Elijah Muhammad, Jr., had flown in from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
Chicago to be present, along with John X Ali, National
Secretary for the movement. Ministers Jeremiah (Baltimore),
Louis X (Boston), and Thomas J. (Hartford) were
there. Minister Woodrow (Atlantic City) was on hand with
his camera crew, and Joseph X, captain of the New York
Fruit, turned his men out in full dress. This was clearly a
major move, and the Muslims had worked hard to underscore
its importance.</p>

<p>But what did it all mean?</p>

<p>&#8220;Now if we can unify,&#8221; Akbar continued, &#8220;we can get
help. I have just come from Africa,&#8221; he said with a sly
smile, &#8220;and I bring you a message from our African brothers.
Now you newsmen get this correct. I am only bringing
a message to the people, a message sent by their brothers
in Africa. This is the message: Spokesmen from African
states&mdash;I&#8217;ll even go so far as to tell you that they are on
the west coast of Africa&mdash;told me to tell you that if you
unite, they are ready to help us win our freedom. They
are ready to help us with arms, men, and know-how!&#8221;</p>

<p>The crowds at such street rallies in Harlem are always
infiltrated with black nationalists, and the mere thought
of Africans sending arms, men, and know-how to aid the
American Negro was enough to set off rejoicing.</p>

<p>To the dismay of newsmen, who hoped he would go into
the who, what, when, where, and how of all this, Akbar
let the matter drop. Instead he turned to a discussion of
the white man.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t hate any man because of the color of his skin,&#8221;
Akbar said. &#8220;I look at a man&#8217;s heart, I watch his actions,
and I make my conclusions on the basis of what he does
rather than how he looks.&#8221;</p>

<p>There are two ways of interpreting what Akbar said:
He could have been saying that action, not skin color, was
the determining factor in any moral judgment; or he could
have been spouting the Muslim line that the white man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
can prove he is not evil by nature by acting correctly.
Either way, what Akbar was saying is a long way from
the strong line preached by both Malcolm X and Elijah.
And when this is coupled with Akbar&#8217;s public denunciation
of those Negro leaders who call other Negro leaders names,
his speech takes on an even stranger character.</p>

<p>Akbar closed his talk with a call for unity among black
men all over the world. &#8220;What we must have,&#8221; he said,
&#8220;is unity among American Negroes; once we get that,
Africans are willing to help us with men, guns, and know-how.
Then we can proceed to unity of black men all over
the world.&#8221;</p>

<p>As Akbar finished, the crowd applauded with vigor; they
were all aware that they had witnessed a peculiar thing.
First, Akbar had not mentioned the separate state a single
time during his speech. This is indeed strange coming from
the son of the Messenger, the man whose basic tenet is a
call for &#8220;several states&#8221; where Negroes can form their own
government. Second, Akbar did not once use the phrase,
&#8220;The Honorable Elijah Muhammad.&#8221; He made only one
reference to his father, and that came when he said, &#8220;The
Teacher tells us that we should prepare ourselves for black
unity.&#8221; Most of all, Akbar&#8217;s talk had none of the strident
denunciations of white men that one expects to hear at a
Black Muslim rally.</p>

<p>It was Malcolm X who pointed up the strangeness of
the doctrine we had heard.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am guilty!&#8221; Malcolm told the crowd after Akbar
finished. &#8220;I am guilty of calling other Negro leaders names.
As you know, no one has done more of that recently than
I have. But today we have heard a new teaching, and we
are all going to abide by it.... Now brothers with the
white buckets will pass among you. And you integrate
those white buckets with some green dollar bills. Meanwhile
I am going to talk to you.... If you help Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
Muhammad, you are helping the man who has helped you.
The Honorable Elijah Muhammad is the man who has
told you the truth about yourself; The Honorable Elijah
Muhammad is the man who has told you the truth about
the white man.... The Honorable Elijah Muhammad is
the man who has made it possible for Brother Akbar to
go to school back home in Egypt; The Honorable Elijah
Muhammad is the man who tells you to stand up; The
Honorable Elijah Muhammad is the man who tells you to
look up; The Honorable Elijah Muhammad is the man
who tells you to clean yourself up, provide for your wife
and children, protect your family. The Honorable Elijah
Muhammad will make you stop drinking; The Honorable
Elijah Muhammad will make you stop stealing; The Honorable
Elijah Muhammad will make you be true to your family;
The Honorable Elijah Muhammad will get that monkey
[dope addiction] off your back; The Honorable Elijah
Muhammad will get this white, blue-eyed gorilla off your
back!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Make it plain, Brother Minister, make it plain.&#8221;</p>

<p>Black men and their women all up and down the streets
shouted and jumped for joy. This was what they had come
to hear in the first place. Big Red had made their cups
run over. Now they were ready to go home.</p>

<p>The Harlem rally was Akbar&#8217;s hour. Malcolm X had
given the Messenger&#8217;s son, the bright kid away at school
in Egypt, a major New York hearing with the press in
full attendance. And Akbar had acted like an Arab; he
had talked traditional Islam and preached black unity. It
was abundantly clear that Akbar is much more committed
to Africa than he is to a separate black state here in America.
He reflects the Arabs&#8217; involvement with black unity
throughout the world. And here lies the schism, for it is
clear that Malcolm X is closer to Elijah Muhammad, in
terms of just what the American Negro should do, than is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
Elijah&#8217;s own son. This schism, however, is not as wide
or as serious as the Muslims&#8217; detractors would have it.
Elijah&#8217;s big point is that the Negro should have a separate
state; the Arabs simply shrug this off. But the imminent
fall of white civilization is something upon which they all
agree and for which they are all preparing.</p>

<p>One can expect, then, that the Black Muslims will become
more &#8220;Islamic&#8221; and more &#8220;political&#8221; in the days just
ahead. The new emphasis on traditional Islam will be primarily
a matter of ritual and temple organization; the new
&#8220;political&#8221; attitude will be an attempt at a social ethic that
would place the Muslims in favor with the black masses
without committing them to &#8220;integration&#8221; causes.</p>

<p>But this is a holding operation, something the Black
Muslims, like God, suffer to be so. They are going to effect
an accommodation with the Negro Revolt, but they are
certain that the American white power structure will defraud
us all. Then the Nation of Islam can say, &#8220;We told
you so,&#8221; and sound the bugle for Armageddon.</p>

<p>How sound would such a new policy be?</p>

<p>From an organizational point of view I think it would
make sense. Not only is it the most liberal position they can
possibly accommodate, but it shows that some&mdash;perhaps
quite a few people&mdash;inside the movement are thinking
creatively. As a non-Muslim, I have much the same reservations
about the new policy as I had about the old. I don&#8217;t
share their total pessimism on how the Negro Revolt will
end. I can foresee a situation in which the white power
structure fails to yield and Negroes start trouble; that not
only can happen, but it probably will happen in isolated
pockets before the race issue is settled. I doubt that the
trouble will be nation-wide, but even widespread rioting
would not necessarily mean the triumph of the Black
Muslims.</p>

<p>To state it bluntly, Negroes, as we have done in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
past, can have a race riot without becoming Black Muslims!</p>

<p>Let there be no denying that such a tragedy will play
into the hands of the Black Muslims; there are, indeed,
grave risks involved, and the best way to avoid them is
to see to it that the tragedy doesn&#8217;t occur.</p>


<h4><i>Peace Be Unto You</i></h4>

<p>The Black Muslim movement is undeniably a sect, if for
no other reason than that it is dominated and run by
charismatic leadership. The Honorable Elijah Muhammad
is the mystical and powerful presence of the movement,
the meaning around which everything else occurs and
orbits. Elijah Muhammad has never claimed immortality;
thus even the Black Muslims know he will eventually die.
Critics of the movement predict that there will be a
frenetic, perhaps bloody, scramble for leadership at Muhammad&#8217;s
death. My prediction is that the Black Muslim hierarchy
will gather in conclave and that they will come out
with a new leader. That leader will not be Malcolm X.
Rather, I suggest that Malcolm, John, and Sharrieff will
be retained in the posts they now occupy and a younger
man&mdash;almost certainly one of Muhammad&#8217;s sons&mdash;will be
the new Messenger.</p>

<p>There are three reasons why I feel this will prove true:</p>

<p>1. The mystique of the movement is that Muhammad
met and knew Allah&mdash;Fard. Thus it follows that the flesh
and blood of Muhammad has inherited the magic of that
encounter. Muhammad will be raised to sainthood, and
the Muslim gospel will continue to be prefaced with the
phrase, &#8220;The Honorable Elijah Muhammad taught us....&#8221;
Thus the new Messenger should be a physical reminder
of Elijah.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>2. John and Sharrieff are sensible, practical men. They
know the impact Malcolm has made on the American
scene, and they will keep him precisely where he is, for
this is the only way they can stay where they are.</p>

<p>3. Finally, I am persuaded of the morality of these Black
Muslim leaders. Think of their doctrine what one may, I
am convinced that they would no more fight publicly over
the question of leadership than would the cardinals of the
Roman Church. Indeed, I feel the conclave will move
just as the Catholic Church has often moved, that the question
of a new leader will be overshadowed by a debate over
policy. I see Malcolm, then, not as the maximum leader,
but as prime minister and behind-the-scenes policy maker.</p>

<p>This is no cause for rejoicing. Akbar Muhammad, who
I suspect will be the new Messenger, is steeped in traditional
Islam. He will bring to the maximum-leadership post
the zeal and determination one associates with the early
Mohammedans. Followers of Allah have always been
strong on internal brotherhood and notoriously short of
patience and mercy toward outsiders. Those of us who
have studied the movement have had to stand muster before
Raymond Sharrieff, and to a man we are agreed that
we would not enjoy tangling with him and The Fruit.
Once Elijah is dead, I suspect the prospect of tangling
with him will be even less inviting.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll be honest with you,&#8221; Malcolm X said to me. &#8220;Everybody
is talking about differences between the Messenger
and me. It is absolutely impossible for us to differ. What
he says is law; that is what is done. But I&#8217;ll tell you this,&#8221;
he added. &#8220;Mr. Muhammad was with Allah, and he has
been granted divine patience; he is willing to wait on God
to deal with the devil. Well, the rest of us have not seen
Allah; we don&#8217;t have this divine patience, and we are not
so willing to wait on God. The younger Black Muslims
want to see some action!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>For the first and, to my knowledge, only time Malcolm
deviated from the Messenger&#8217;s position when he said that.
Malcolm X means it, he is not alone: Akbar means it,
John X means it, Sharrieff means it, and Wallace, another
son of Elijah&#8217;s, means it. These men are waiting for integration
to fail. This republic would do well to take them
seriously.</p>

<p>The Black Muslims will endure but they will not prevail.
Rather, they will linger for years to come and be a constant
reminder of what this republic did to thousands who sought
its promise. They will integrate this nation&#8217;s body politic
and make us continually aware of what can happen if white
men don&#8217;t learn to love before black men learn to hate.
And maybe one day before I die we can all join together&mdash;black
and white and Malcolm X&mdash;and say, &#8220;<i>As-Salaam-Alaikum</i>.&#8221;
That is to say, peace be unto you.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">1. MUHAMMAD<br />
AT ATLANTA</h3></div>


<p>&#8220;<i>Come and see and hear the most fearless black man in
America today; the man who is going to defy the Ku Klux
Klan!</i>&#8221;</p>

<p><i>This is the way the Black Muslims billboarded Elijah
Muhammad&#8217;s now-famous &#8220;Atlanta Speech&#8221; of 1961. For
when it was announced that Muhammad was to speak in
Atlanta, the Klan issued a statement that they, too, would
hold a rally and a march on the same day, at the same
time. The Black Muslims&#8217; propaganda machinery went into
action, and the Atlanta Speech was advertised as a major
confrontation between Elijah and the Klan. Something a
little different from that is what actually occurred.</i></p>

<p><i>Malcolm X flew into Atlanta several days before the
scheduled meeting and began talks with police and other
city officials. Malcolm was assured that the police would
enforce law and order, that the Black Muslims could
proceed with their meeting without fear of trouble from
the Klan or anyone else.</i></p>

<p><i>Even so, the Black Muslims took advantage of every
opportunity to dramatize their presence and activities.</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
<i>Long before the meeting began members of The Fruit
of Islam took up posts on rooftops overlooking the route
Muhammad would travel to Magnolia Hall. Even more
Fruit cordoned the hall itself. With a seating capacity of
only five hundred, the auditorium was jammed hours before
the meeting began; another two thousand people
lined up along the dirt road leading to the auditorium and
heard the speech over loud-speakers. They would have fared
just as well had they stayed home since the entire five-hour
speech was broadcast over a local Negro-oriented
radio station.</i></p>

<p><i>The expectation mounted as word came that Muhammad
had landed at the airport; several minutes later it was
announced that Muhammad was taking a few moments of
ease at the home of the local minister; then word came
that The Honorable Elijah Muhammad was en route to
the temple.</i></p>

<p><i>The Fruit of Islam formed themselves into a double
column that stretched from the platform inside the auditorium,
out the front door, down the steps, and across
the sidewalk to the curb where Elijah would disembark.</i></p>

<p><i>As the crowd cheered, a long black limousine pulled up
to the auditorium and Elijah Muhammad&mdash;a five-foot-five,
unimpressive little man&mdash;along with a retinue of some six
members of his family swept into the building down the
corridor formed by The Fruit. The applause inside the
temple was loud and sustained; nervously adjusting his
bow tie, Elijah Muhammad, the Messenger of Allah, took
several bows before the people resumed their seats.</i></p>

<p><i>After a long and impassioned introduction by Malcolm
X, Elijah Muhammad rose to speak. Most of that long,
rambling lecture follows. It is a full statement of Black
Muslim doctrine replete with attacks on Negro leaders&mdash;Negro
preachers in particular. Herein we will find a detailed
account of how the evil black scientist Yakub created</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
<i>the white world; we learn why the white race has endured
for so long; but most of all Elijah used the Atlanta Speech
to make an impassioned plea to Negroes to become &#8220;fearless.&#8221;
[Observers feel that Muhammad&#8217;s repetitious urging
that Negroes cease to fear white people is one of his
strongest attractions for the Negro masses.]</i></p>

<p><i>Of particular interest, at least to me, is the Paulinean
stance Elijah Muhammad assumes in this speech. He
begins by offering greetings of peace and the good life;
then he goes on to thank his local minister, Jeremiah X,
for having arranged this meeting. This done, Muhammad
links the Black Muslims with the &#8220;725 million more brothers
and sisters in the World of Islam,&#8221; and issues a special
note of thanks to those of his followers who have come
from as far away as California.</i></p>

<p><i>Finally, I wish to underscore the closing of this speech:
&#8220;I am God&#8217;s last Messenger to you. You must accept Allah
as God.&#8221; This is the only time I have encountered the
doctrine of Elijah as the last Messenger. But it bolsters
my suggestion that when he dies, Muhammad will still be
&#8220;The Messenger&#8221; and that the new leader of the movement
will be a younger man, a titular head, while strong men
like Malcolm X and Raymond Sharrieff carry the load.</i></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">As-salaam-alaikum</span>: In the name of Allah, the most
Merciful God, to whom all holy praises are due, the Lord
of all the worlds; the most Merciful Finder (of) and
Lifegiver to the Lost-found, mentally dead so-called Negroes
here in the Wilderness of North America.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>My Beloved Brothers and Sisters:</p>

<p>I am more than honored by your presence here this afternoon
and your sincere welcome to me and to my followers
here in this great city of Atlanta.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>I thank Allah for Minister Jeremiah, my faithful minister
here whose tireless efforts in Atlanta and throughout the
South have made this great gathering here today possible.
The work that Minister Jeremiah has been doing here in
the South has pleased Allah, and it has pleased me too.</p>

<p>Year after year I receive letters from many converts here
in Atlanta, and I know that the Word of Allah is spreading
rapidly among our people here in the South because of the
ever increasing volume of your letters to me.</p>

<p>And, my beloved people, I want you to know that those
of you here in Atlanta and in other parts of the South
who accept Islam, which is the true religion of Almighty
God, are not alone. Not only do you have a fast-growing
number of brothers and sisters in all of the Northern cities,
but you have 725 million more brothers and sisters in the
World of Islam.</p>

<p>I am also thankful to my followers who have traveled
here to Atlanta to be with me today from my various
temples throughout America, and especially the caravan
of young Muslims who motored over 2,000 miles all the
way from Los Angeles, California, to be here on this grand
occasion.</p>

<p>My followers are with me wherever I go, and it is wonderful
to have such sincere people who will follow you
all around the country like this because it shows unity, and
it also shows there is no religion that can produce unity
like the unity produced by Islam. Yes, today the Muslims
are in all the major cities of America, and if you look
around in the smaller cities you will find us there also. Just
walk around saying, &#8220;As-Salaam-Alaikum,&#8221; and pretty soon
someone will reply, &#8220;Wa-Alaikum-Salaam.&#8221;</p>

<p>Beloved brothers and sisters, again I must thank Allah
for permitting me to be in your presence here in Atlanta
this afternoon. I am thankful also to the Atlanta Police<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
Department for the courtesies they have shown us here in
this city, and I want everyone to know we are a people
who are grateful to anyone who is nice to us, and peaceful
toward us. We are a people of peace. We are seeking to
spread brotherly love among the so-called Negroes for it is
they who have been deprived of brotherly love. We (Muslims)
have come through the same trials and tribulations
as they have, and now we want them to see and share the
brotherhood that Islam has given us.</p>

<p>Islam is not a new religion. Islam is not a religion that
has been organized by the white man. Islam is the religion
of God Himself, and Islam is the religion of all the prophets
of God, from Adam to Muhammad (the last). Islam was
the religion of Moses, Noah, Abraham, and Jesus. Islam
will be the last of the three great religions (Buddhism,
Christianity, and Islam) that now dominate the earth.</p>

<p>Islam must be the last of these three great religions because
God Himself is the Author of Islam, and Islam is
to bring peace and contentment after this war and trouble-making
world which you now know has been destroyed
... and you can see that this trouble-making world is
already on its way out.</p>

<p>Islam has not made great progress for the past 6,000
years because this is the religion that God Himself would
spread in the &#8220;last days.&#8221; If Islam had been forced upon
all the people of the earth during the past 6,000 years there
would not have been any &#8220;World of Christianity,&#8221; there
would not have been any &#8220;World of Buddhism&#8221; ... and
there would never have been anything like the &#8220;Caucasian
World.&#8221; Islam would have prevented their progress. God
Himself has held Islam &#8220;in check&#8221; to give these other
&#8220;worlds&#8221; free reign during the past 6,000 years.</p>

<p>But, Islam was the religion of the black people who
lived before Adam was made, as far back as 66 trillion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
years ago when the earth and the moon were together and
formed one and the same planet ... and which at that
time was called &#8220;moon&#8221; instead of earth.</p>

<p>According to the word of Allah to me, one of our wise
black scientists was upset over the dialect the people were
speaking, and he wanted to change the language and make
all of the people speak the same dialect. He became angry
because he could not get the others to go along with him,
and when he saw that he could not accomplish what he
wanted, he drilled a huge shaft into this planet for about
four or five thousand miles deep, and filling that hole with
high explosives he set it off, with the intention of destroying
all civilization. He thought he would get rid of us.</p>

<p>That part of the planet which we call &#8220;moon&#8221; today was
blasted 12,000 miles from its original pocket that it had
been rotating in at the time of the explosion, and this part
that we call &#8220;earth&#8221; today dropped 36,000 miles from that
pocket and found another pocket and started rotating again
... (it all happened in the twinkling of an eye) ... and
that part (moon) that was blasted away dropped all of
its water upon this part (earth), and this is why three-fourths
of the earth&#8217;s surface today is covered by water,
and also why there is no life on the moon.</p>

<p>We are the people who devised that great destruction of
our planet. That part (moon) that you see up there in the
sky shining at night was once joined with this part (earth)
that we now five on. Before the explosion the entire planet
was then called &#8220;moon.&#8221; (Not really by the word &#8220;moon&#8221;
that we use today, but by a word in Arabic that means
practically the same thing.) We will have another great
destruction, and we will provide that one too. We ourselves
(the black nation) are a people who can never be destroyed.
There never was a time when we (the black nation)
didn&#8217;t exist. We don&#8217;t have any birth record of the
black nation. We have no beginning and we have no ending.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
So don&#8217;t talk about getting rid of the Black Man, because
you cannot do it.</p>

<p>Again I say, we are happy to be in Atlanta today, the
capital of Georgia ... my birth state. I was born in this
state, and grew up in this state. I was a grown man, married
and the father of children even before I left this state.
So don&#8217;t try and make me acquainted with Georgia. I am
already acquainted with Georgia.</p>

<p>This great city of Atlanta with its five colleges, institutions
of learning, is one of America&#8217;s most important cities,
and is even the gateway to the South. We thank the city
for permitting us to enter it, and the courtesy of the police
department, and the mayor of this great city, and the
governor of the state. We are happy to be called one of
your own state-borned sons.</p>

<p>My beloved people, I am one of your brothers; I am
not a foreigner, but I have a Divine Message from the Lord
of the Worlds that sounds foreign to you because you have
not heard it before.</p>

<p>I want you to know that we so-called Negroes are the
people who have been on this planet for trillions of years.
I say so-called Negro because you are not a Negro. You
are members of the Asiatic Nation, from the Tribe of
Shabazz. There is no such thing as a race of Negroes. This
is a false name given you during slavery by your slave
master, who, after robbing you completely of your knowledge
of your homeland, your parents, and your culture,
called you &#8220;Negro&#8221; or Nigger because that word means
something that is &#8220;NEUTER&#8221; or &#8220;NEUTRAL.&#8221; Therefore
you are now a little group of people on this earth who
stand out because you have become neutralized by ignorance
of yourself and your own kind, and of your enemy.
You are &#8220;neutral&#8221; ... not united with yourselves, among
yourselves, nor are you united with your own people of
your own world.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>Since ignorance of self and hatred of self makes you
reluctant to unite with your own kind, and despite your
love and worship of your slave master he will not let you
unite with him ... thus you are in the middle, standing
alone, neutralized by your own lack of knowledge, unacceptable
to either friend or foe ... NEGROES!!!</p>

<p>This is why you are called NEGRO. The slave master
gave you this name because he understood the meaning of
it, although Webster has cunningly kept you away from
the true meaning of it by saying it refers to black people
... and especially the black African who has no education
or independence.</p>

<p>My dear brothers and sisters, and distinguished educators
of Atlanta, you have often wondered why you had
to call yourselves by this name &#8220;Negro.&#8221; It has been due
to the fact that you didn&#8217;t know its origin and you didn&#8217;t
know your origin. You have been asleep. You don&#8217;t know
whom you are from, where you are from, where you are
going, how you should stand, how you should sit ... you
know nothing at all but what your slave master chooses to
tell you, and since he tells you only that which will benefit
himself and his own kind, you have been made into a
NEUTRAL person ... a shiftless, helpless NEGRO.</p>

<p>If the white man says to you, &#8220;Johnny, go back home, I
have no work for you today,&#8221; you go back home and sit
down and wait for the white man to send for you (when
he sees fit) to come back and work on his job. You don&#8217;t
try to create a job for yourself. You are shiftless because
the lack of &#8220;proper&#8221; education and self-knowledge has left
you lifeless (mentally, economically, and otherwise).</p>

<p>I am not making fun of you. I am trying to lead you to
the point where you can see the basic cause of your condition.
I am one of you. I came through the same trials
and tribulation and the same hell that you did. What I
say about you I am also saying it about myself. I am your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
brother; I am here, if necessary, to give my life to save
yours. I am not running from death. I am running to save
your life. So take me for a friend and not an enemy.</p>

<p>You must learn to make jobs for yourselves so that the
next time &#8220;boss&#8221; tells you he does not have any work for
you, you can tell him that you are going to do some work
for yourself.</p>

<p>Three hundred years under the persecution of your slave
master has made you into a blind, deaf, and dumb ...
and an absolutely &#8220;dead&#8221; people. He has taught you to
eat the rotten and worse type of foods, even the flesh of
that poisonous animal, the swine (pork) ... filling your
stomach with this poison meat (pork) has deteriorated you
physically, mentally as well as morally. The Arab word for
the pig is &#8220;Khainsuer.&#8221; (&#8220;khain&#8221; means &#8220;I see,&#8221; and &#8220;suer&#8221;
means &#8220;very foul.&#8221;) This word thus means &#8220;I see something
that is very foul, filthy, diseased&#8221; ... something that is not
fit to be eaten by intelligent, civilized people.</p>

<p>Your slave master reared you on this poisonous meat,
which has dulled your brains, and you ceased to think
about your past history, and then you were deprived easily
of the knowledge of your own God and your own religion.
Thus it became easy for the slave master to deprive you
also of the knowledge of your own kind, and the knowledge
of his kind. Now you don&#8217;t know the way back to your
own kind, and his kind won&#8217;t accept you ... so they call
you Nigger or Negro, which means deaf, dumb, and blind
... neutral, dead, lifeless.</p>

<p>We, the Nation of Islam, who believe in freedom, justice
and equality stand not only before you today, but
before the entire world as we declare this truth about the
American so-called Negroes. The nations of earth are faced
today with a worse problem than has ever presented itself
in the history of mankind, and the primary ingredient of
this great &#8220;world problem&#8221; involves the condition and position<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
of the so-called Negro here in America ... 20 million
ex-slaves who have become a nation within a nation and
who are now crying out for something that they can call
their own. This is creating a problem not only for America,
but for the entire world, and that problem is: how to give
you a knowledge and understanding of yourself, teach you
the knowledge of your own God and your own religion,
and to teach you the knowledge of your own nation so that
you can make a stand for yourselves as other nations are
making for themselves.</p>

<p>This problem is so delicate and complicated that only
God Himself can solve it. I am not a man who has grabbed
a suitcase with a bible in it upon my own impulses. No!
I stand before you as a man who has been chosen for you
by God Himself. I did not choose myself. This must be
made clear! The Divine Revelation which I have received
and which I am preaching to you and to the entire world
came to me from the Mouth of God.</p>

<p>I did not see Him in a vision and receive my mission in a
vision as others before me received theirs. I was in the
Presence of God for over three years, and I received what
I am teaching you directly from His Mouth.</p>

<p>Let the infidels curse and swear at me. Let the infidels
go on the warpath of propaganda against Elijah, but I
warn you: &#8220;You better listen today to him who has received
his instructions directly from the Mouth of Almighty
God.&#8221; I did not receive this gospel from a paper, nor a
book, nor from a vision, nor from an angel, but directly
from the Mouth of Almighty God Himself.</p>

<p>My beloved people: I know your problems and your
burdens; I know your problems and your burdens; I know
what you go through; you don&#8217;t have to tell me ... for I
have the ABSOLUTE CURE for all your problems and ailments.
All you have to do is listen to what I say, and then
jump up on your feet and follow me.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>I don&#8217;t want you to be too proud, as others were in
former times; they were too proud to follow the words of
the prophets. I don&#8217;t want you to be like that. I want you
to place more value on your life than they did. Think something
of your future, and your children, and your people.
Accept Allah and His religion and follow me and I will
lead you to Him and to a heaven right here on this earth.
Come and follow me, and you will not have to wait until
after you die to see God, nor will you have to wait until
after you die to enjoy a heaven somewhere up in the sky.</p>

<p>Beloved brothers and sisters: after receiving this Divine
Revelation that I am teaching you from the Mouth of God,
I have not stopped one day for the last twenty-nine years.
I have been standing, preaching to you throughout these
past twenty-nine years, while I was free and even while
I was in bondage. I spent three and one-half years in the
federal penitentiary and also over a year in the city jail
for teaching this truth. I was also deprived of a father&#8217;s
love for his family for seven long years while I was running
from hypocrites and other enemies of this word
and revelation of God, and which will give life to you and
put you on the same level with all other civilized and
independent nations of this earth ... and this is the greatest
desire of Almighty God Allah and Elijah Muhammad.
This afternoon I want to teach the so-called American
Negroes the true knowledge of themselves that will lift
them from the bottom and place them back at the top of
civilization.</p>

<p>I know how you feel. I know how you think. You think
as Ezekiel says of you. Ezekiel says, &#8220;This whole House of
Israel, they say their hope was lost and they were cut off
from their fathers.&#8221; You are a people who are all hopeless
because you think there is no hope for you. You think that
because you have been cut off from your own people for
so long there is no chance of you ever uniting or of ever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
becoming anything but what you now are. I say you are
wrong. The God of your Fathers, whose proper name is
Allah, will strengthen you and cause you to stand upon
your own feet as an independent people in the eyes of
other people on this earth.</p>

<p>This Truth that I am teaching will raise you up from
the grave, not out of the earthly grave, but out of the
&#8220;grave of ignorance.&#8221; You just need the knowledge of yourself,
your own God and your own religion. God has missioned
me to give you this Truth: freedom, justice, and
equality.</p>

<p>These are the things I must teach you about: freedom
first, because you have never been free here in America.
You know nothing about the pleasures or happiness of a
free person. You know nothing about justice. You know
nothing about equality, or being equal with other civilized
nations of earth.</p>

<p>I know you and your thoughts about me and what I
teach. Inwardly, some of you are with me 100 per cent, but
outwardly you are not. Why? Because you have the greatest
enemy over you a man can have, and that is &#8220;FEAR.&#8221;
Fear is your greatest enemy. You were filled with fear of
your slave master when you were little babies, over 400
years ago when our fathers were brought in chains to the
Western Hemisphere on a slave ship that was named &#8220;The
Good Ship Jesus.&#8221; The captain of that ship was an English
Christian named John Hawkins.</p>

<p>The American white people had come to this country
from Europe and had already begun to subdue the Indians.
We were brought here to a people who could not
speak our language nor could we speak theirs. Thus the
language of our forefathers was soon destroyed, and you
know nothing about it today. The language of the slave
master was forced upon our foreparents, and they were
brought up also wearing the names of the slave masters.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
Today, you are still speaking their language and wearing
their names.</p>

<p>During 300 long years of slavery you were deprived of
the privilege of even going to church, and there were no
such things as schools for you in those days. Besides depriving
you of education the slave master did not teach
you about God, Jesus, and the Holy Ghost that he is now
teaching you about today. You were never allowed to sit
with them in their churches until just a few years ago.</p>

<p>Beloved brothers and sisters, think over this: for over
400 years you had no knowledge of yourselves, no knowledge
of your own religion, and no knowledge of the biblical
prophecies and predictions pertaining to the &#8220;lost people&#8221;
who would be on this planet until the last days, and whom
God Himself would have to search for and then save them
from the clutches of their enemies. You have never been
given a knowledge of that because your slave master knew
those prophecies were speaking about you (the American
so-called Negroes).</p>

<p>For less than 100 years now a little bit of the Christian
religion has been taught to you in a diluted form, but
never the full text of it. You have never learned the prophetic
fate of Christianity, nor do you know anything about
the Caucasian people who have translated the bible into
their language. Yet, you are a people who think you know
all about the bible, and all about Christianity, and you
are even foolish enough to believe that nothing is right
but Christianity.</p>

<p>Your slave master tampered with the words of the bible;
he &#8220;translated&#8221; it; he &#8220;revised&#8221; it; he fixed the reading of
it to make you a worse slave than your foreparents were.
The slave master is the &#8220;god&#8221; who &#8220;sent&#8221; some of your
fellow slaves to preach to you. Their favorite text was,
&#8220;Servant, obey your master.&#8221; But he didn&#8217;t really have to
preach that because the lashes of the whip upon the backs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
of your parents for 300 years had beaten them into obedient
submission.</p>

<p>But, my beloved brothers and sisters, the Christian religion
you now are believing in so strongly came down to
you from your slave masters. They kept that religion and
its secrets guarded from your parents&#8217; ears for 300 years.
What was then so sacred in Christianity? What was so
sacred in the bible which they kept locked away from the
slaves? What was so sacred about these things that the
slave master did not want his slaves to read or even hear
preached? If it was so good, why didn&#8217;t he want his slave
to hear this good then? Why didn&#8217;t he want his slave to
believe in God then?</p>

<p>First of all, the slave master did not want the slaves to
know the truth about God nor about His true religion,
fearing that the slave would then begin looking for his God
to deliver him from his white oppressors.</p>

<p>I know some of you are afraid to listen to this truth
but I am going to preach it to you until you are free of
that fear. A man told me a few years ago that I would be
wasting my time to come to Georgia. He said that the
Negroes in Georgia were more afraid of white people than
you will find anywhere else on this earth. I told him that
I myself was born in Georgia and did not see why they
should be afraid of the white man. I told him that I was a
grown man, married and with two children when I left
Georgia. I also told him that they need not fear the white
man; the only thing they need to fear is the fear within
themselves.</p>

<p>I say to you that your fear of the white man is THE
GREAT EVIL. Fear is of such nature that it will make
you deprive yourself of your own salvation. Fear is the
enemy that will make you stoop and bring yourself to disgrace
before the world. Fear is the real enemy that you and
I should throw into the garbage can.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>My beloved brothers and sisters, how could you accept
of God, Jesus and the Holy Ghost. How do you know? I
am not asking you to answer these questions, because God
has missioned me to answer them for you. You don&#8217;t know
the answers. All you know is what you have heard your
slave master say.</p>

<p>You say Christianity is the right religion and that you
believe in God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy
Ghost. You believe that this Jesus is God&#8217;s son, and that
He gave His son to save you. You say that the Holy Ghost
&#8220;overpowered&#8221; a virgin girl named Mary, yet you don&#8217;t
call the child the son of the Holy Ghost, you call the child
&#8220;the son of God.&#8221; You charge God with being the father
of this virgin girl&#8217;s child.</p>

<p>My beloved brothers and sisters, how could you accept
a religion that teaches you to believe the God of Righteousness
was responsible for making a virgin girl in Palestine
pregnant with a child 2,000 years ago, called this child his
&#8220;son,&#8221; and let this &#8220;son&#8221; die for the sins of the wicked
world?</p>

<p>When a man is not married to a woman and he commits
such a sinful act it is called adultery. God is not
married to a woman, and if He commits such a sinful act
that produces a child out of wedlock, which actually opens
the gateway of adultery to the entire world, then it is a
shame to ask me to believe in that god.</p>

<p>We in Islam do not ascribe &#8220;sonship&#8221; to Almighty God,
because He has no son. All of us are His &#8220;spiritual&#8221; children,
but He has no physical son. To say that God has
produced a physical son out of wedlock (without being
married to the mother of that son), and then placed this
son before our eyes and said, &#8220;This is my beloved son; all
who believe in him and follow him shall be saved,&#8221; actually
opens the gateway for all kinds of adultery and other
indecent acts.</p>





<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>God had already told His prophet Moses that the people
should be stoned to death for adultery. Now if God had
come 2,000 years after giving the law against adultery to
Moses, and after &#8220;courting&#8221; or &#8220;overpowering&#8221; Mary, and
she was a virgin girl who had never been touched by any
man, and yet she became pregnant with His child, and
that child is the flesh and blood &#8220;son&#8221; of God ... then
the Christians are charging God Himself with having committed
adultery with Mary.</p>

<p>This just could not have been done if God was a spirit.
If He was a spirit He could not father a flesh and blood
son. He would have to have a son like Himself. If He was
a spirit, then His son would have to be a spirit too. And,
if He did beget a son by Mary, then all other women
would be justified in producing sons that same way, by
committing adultery and then blaming it on the &#8220;spirit.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Western World is always defending Christianity
and they mock me and other Islamic teachers. They do not
want Islam preached to you, but the reason you are hearing
it today is because it is time. This preaching of Islam
to you today cannot be stopped; it is like the rising of the
sun ... right on time.</p>

<p>Here in America there are also three and one-half million
indirect believers in Islam, in the secret order called
Shriners, or Higher Masons. When you take the thirty-third
degree in masonry you are no longer called a Mason;
you are then called a Moslem Son, and in that order (or
degree) you are taught the prayers of the Moslems and
you come under the teachings of Islam. In that High Degree
you are taught to turn your face Eastward, toward
the Holy City of Mecca in Arabia. All of this is part of
the Moslem religion, Islam.</p>

<p>Today, Islam must be taught to the so-called American
Negroes. You must learn about this religion, because there
can be no judgment of the devil and his wicked world<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
until after you (the lost people of God) have heard the
truth about God and the truth about the devil as I am
teaching you today. It is only after you have heard the
teachings of Islam that you can make a wise choice between
God and the devil.</p>

<p>We are not trying to force you to accept Islam, but we
are trying to make you realize that we know what is in
store for the world; we know what tomorrow will bring.
Therefore, we are not in fear of losing our lives, but we
will lay down our lives this very minute for the truth. We
are not running from death; we are running only to save
lives ... YOUR LIVES!!!</p>

<p>You must have freedom, justice, and equality. You cannot
be free as long as you are calling yourselves by your
slave master&#8217;s name; you cannot be free as long as you do
not know who you are; you cannot be free as long as you
do not know your own people; you cannot be free as long
as you don&#8217;t know how to even ask for freedom.</p>

<p>Beloved brothers and sisters, God has given me the key
that will open the door of freedom, justice, and equality
that has been locked against you. You must be taught a
knowledge of your own God. My mission is to make you
acquainted with Him, to prepare you to meet Him face
to face.</p>

<p>God is not a mystery today; He is not something invisible.
He is not a spirit. He is not something other than
flesh and blood; He is in the flesh and in the blood. God
is a human being! God would have no joy or pleasure in
humans (us) if He Himself were something other than a
human being. God would have no joy or pleasure in the
material universe if He Himself were other than material.</p>

<p>The devil is also a flesh and blood human being. The
devil is not an invisible spirit. The bible and the Holy
Quran both plainly state that God is going to destroy the
devil in a Lake of Fire in &#8220;the last days.&#8221; If the devil was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
an invisible spirit he could not be destroyed. You can destroy
a man but you cannot destroy a spirit. So I repeat
to you, my beloved brothers and sisters, God and the devil
both are flesh and blood human beings.</p>

<p>There is no such thing as seeing God or the devil after
you die. There is no such thing as a heaven up in the sky
or a hell down in the ground. All of that is fantasy, false
stories made up by your slave master to further enslave
you. God is a man! The devil is a man! Heaven and hell
are two conditions, and both are experienced in this life
right here on this earth. You have already suffered the
worse kind of hell in the hands of the only real devil!</p>

<p>It is the devil who did not want you to know this truth
that God has missioned me to teach my people. He is
afraid that when you learn his real identity you will then
separate yourselves from him and thereby escape the fiery
destruction God has prepared for him. He wants to keep
you from your salvation in the hereafter. He knows that
without this truth that I am teaching you, you could never
avoid the fire that God has ordained for him and enter
into the Hereafter. And by HEREAFTER, we mean the
Kingdom of Righteousness that God will establish &#8220;here&#8221;
on this earth &#8220;after&#8221; the devil has been destroyed in the
Divine Lake of Fire.</p>

<p>Beloved brothers and sisters, it has been predicted by
all the prophets that God is coming. Well, if God is coming
(and He must be coming because the whole world
claims to be &#8220;<i>looking</i>&#8221; for Him), then He must be something
visible. If He is an invisible spirit then the world
wouldn&#8217;t be &#8220;<i>looking</i>&#8221; for Him to come. The world couldn&#8217;t
say, &#8220;We will <i>see</i> Him&#8221; ... because we don&#8217;t &#8220;<i>look</i>&#8221; for a
spirit, we <i>feel</i> for a spirit.</p>

<p>If God is a spirit and He says He made Adam in His
own image and likeness, then I say to you Adam would
have been a spirit. But God did not make a spirit; He made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
a man like Himself. Man looks like God and God looks like
man because God is a man.</p>

<p>Man acts like God; he acts with power. Man does not
just sit down and wait for the wheat to grow itself, harvest
itself, make itself into flour, bake itself, and then bring
itself to him to eat, does he? No!!!</p>

<p>Man plants the wheat, man cultivates it, man threshes
it, man grinds it into flour, man bakes the bread, and then
man eats it. If man sits all day in the house waiting for a
spirit to produce that bread he would starve to death. No
spirit in heaven or in hell will bring you bread ... and
no spirit in heaven or in hell will bring you freedom, justice,
or equality.</p>

<p>I say to you, my beloved brothers and sisters, your slave
master and his imps (the Negro preachers) have blinded
you by such ignorant teachings and today you are still
foolishly sending your praises and your prayers to an invisible
God who is supposed to be somewhere out in
space, and who cannot be found by you until after you die.
And, this same ignorant doctrine has you believing there
is an invisible devil down in the earth somewhere beneath
your feet ... while in reality the devil is right here on
top of the earth, walking around on two feet like you are,
and you are looking at him every day.</p>

<p>God is a man, a flesh and blood being, but He is a Divine
Being. Why do we call God a Divine Being? Because He
is a being like we are but His wisdom, power, and other
capabilities and attributes are Supreme ... making Him
the Highest Power, the Supreme in Power, or Supreme
Power. He is a being like ourselves, but He has the Divine
Capacity of exercising His Power or to project through His
Power the powers of the Universe ... and therefore we call
Him the Supreme Being and the God of the Universe. He
has the Divine Power to will whatever He wishes and to
bring it into existence with His Divine Will. But He is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
not an invisible spirit somewhere up in the sky. His home
is right here on this earth.</p>

<p>I would defy any spirit outside the spirit that is in a
man to do anything for me or to me. I would defy any
devil that is outside of a man to do anything for me or
to me. But I do recognize the devil in these that can do us
harm and have done us harm. No spirit independent of
man can do us harm or good.</p>

<p>Beloved brothers and sisters, let us bring our minds out
of the sky; let us stop being spooky; let us learn to face
reality; let us look around here on this earth as other intelligent
and civilized people are doing. Here in Atlanta
is the seat of education for the so-called Negroes in this
country. Yet most Negroes here are still locked into the
most crowded and undesirable areas. Therefore, I would
like to know what are our educated people doing with this
education to elevate the living standards of your own people,
and to eliminate the misery and poverty yet suffered
by the so-called Negro masses who do not have education?</p>

<p>You who are college graduates, and you who are educators
and instructors here in Atlanta, Georgia: I would
like for you to tell me what you are doing with this education
you have received from the white man toward making
your own people more independent? What are you doing
for your people with your education? Should not you take
that education to unite your people and bring them up out
of the &#8220;mud of ignorance,&#8221; and make them an independent
people? But with all your education you yourself are still
dependent upon your slave master for a job, and for your
food, clothing and shelter. With your education, you have
enough land and farmers to do something about the condition
of the so-called American Negro.</p>

<p>But you must first agree that the most important ingredient
has been omitted from your education, and that
is the knowledge of God, the devil, of yourself, and of your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
enemy. Accept Allah and His true religion (Islam), and
come and follow me. I am God&#8217;s Messenger to you. I have
the keys to your salvation. Come and follow me and I will
show you how to use your education, your skills and talents,
for the good of your own people and yourself.</p>

<p>In the unity and harmony and Brotherhood created by
the religion of Islam, it is easy for us to pool our knowledge
and finance to set up farms and grow food to feed our
people; we can set up factories to manufacture our own
necessities, and other businesses with which we can establish
trade and commerce and become independent as
other civilized people are. Then, in this way you will be
using your education to bring your people out of the slums
and the breadlines. They will cease to be the &#8220;last hired
and the first fired,&#8221; when you use your education to make
jobs for them.</p>

<p>I thank you, my beloved brothers and sisters, for being
here this afternoon, and listening so attentively to this
truth. I am God&#8217;s last Messenger to you. You must accept
Allah as God. You must know that Islam is your religion.
Come and follow me; let me teach you, and I will put
20 million so-called American Negroes overnight on the
road to success ... on the road toward complete independence
in a home of your own, where you will never
any more have to beg anyone for freedom, justice, or
equality.</p>

<p>Thank you, my beloved brothers and sisters. May Allah
forever bless you, as I leave you with the greetings of the
peaceful and the righteous: As-Salaam-Alaikum ... which
means, &#8220;Peace be unto you.&#8221;</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">2. MALCOLM X<br />
AT HARVARD</h3></div>


<p><i>This 1960 speech, delivered by Malcolm X before a jam-packed
Harvard Law School Forum, comes from what I
have called the Black Muslims&#8217; &#8220;rasping&#8221; period. These
were their early days on the national scene, and it would
be interesting to find out if Malcolm would make just such
a speech now.</i></p>

<p><i>Malcolm is clearly on the defensive in the first half of
his long talk; he is responding to criticism rather than
spreading his own gospel. It is only after he has answered
charges that the Black Muslims are not orthodox Muslims;
only after he has denied that the Black Muslims teach hate;
and after he has put the Negro middle class in their place
for their criticism of him&mdash;only after all this does Malcolm
get down to what he really went to Harvard to say.</i></p>

<p><i>In essence it is this: The American Negro must have a
separate state. This is the only way white men can atone
for their sins and escape destruction; this is the only way
Negroes can return to their own.</i></p>

<p><i>The Harvard Speech is the best statement&mdash;and defense&mdash;of
the proposed all-Negro state that the Black Muslims</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
<i>have issued. It shows why I suggest that the Black Muslims
are completely &#8220;Americanized&#8221; in their aims and approaches.
Indeed, the reader will get a good chuckle when
Malcolm delivers a blistering attack on non-American
Moslems, some one hundred thousand of them he says, who
have migrated to this country but have been unable to
gather converts. Then Malcolm reminds them that Elijah
has been able to garner thousands. So then, Malcolm continues,
does this not mean that The Honorable Elijah
Muhammad is indeed the Messenger?</i></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. chairman, ladies and gentlemen</span>:</p>

<p>We thank you for inviting us here to the Harvard Law
School Forum this evening to present our views on this
timely topic: THE AMERICAN NEGRO; PROBLEMS
AND SOLUTIONS. But to understand our views, the
views of the Black Muslims, you must first realize that we
are a religious group, and you must also know something
about our religion, the religion of ISLAM.</p>

<p>The Creator of the Universe, whom many of you call
God or Jehovah, is known to the Muslims by the name
ALLAH. Since the Muslims believe there is but ONE
GOD, and that all the prophets came from this ONE GOD,
we believe also that all prophets taught the same religion,
and that they themselves called that religion ISLAM, an
Arabic word that means the complete submission and
obedience to the will of ALLAH.</p>

<p>One who practices this Divine Obedience is called a
MUSLIM (commonly known, spelled, and referred to here
in the West as Moslem).</p>

<p>There are over 725 million Muslims on this earth, predominantly
in Africa and Asia, the non-white world ...
and we here in America who are under the Divine Leadership
of The Honorable Elijah Muhammad, are an integral<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
part of the vast World of Islam that stretches from the
China Seas to the sunny shores of West Africa.</p>

<p>A unique situation faces the 20 million ex-slaves here
in America because of our unique condition, thus our acceptance
of Islam, and into Islam, affects us uniquely ...
differently than all other Muslim &#8220;converts&#8221; anywhere else
on this earth.</p>

<p>Mr. Elijah Muhammad is our Divine Leader and Teacher
here in America. Mr. Muhammad believes in and obeys
God 100 per cent, and is teaching and working among our
people to fulfill God&#8217;s Divine Purpose today.</p>

<p>I am here at this Harvard Law School Forum this evening
to represent Mr. Elijah Muhammad, the spiritual head
of the fastest-growing group of Black Muslims in the Western
Hemisphere.</p>

<p>We who follow Mr. Muhammad know that he has been
divinely taught and sent to us by God Himself. We believe
that the miserable plight of the 20 million black people
in America is the fulfillment of divine prophecy. We believe
that the serious race problem that our presence here
poses for America is also the fulfillment of divine prophecy.
We also believe that the presence today in America of
The Honorable Elijah Muhammad, his teachings among
the 20 million so-called Negroes, and his naked warning
to America concerning her treatment of these 20 million
ex-slaves is all the fulfillment of divine prophecy.</p>

<p>Therefore, when Mr. Muhammad declares that the only
solution to America&#8217;s serious race problem is complete
SEPARATION of the two races, he is fulfilling that which
was predicted by all of the biblical prophets to take place
in this day.</p>

<p>But, because Mr. Muhammad takes this uncompromising
stand, those of you who don&#8217;t understand biblical prophecy
wrongly label him as a racist, a hate teacher, or of being
anti-white, and of teaching black supremacy.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>But, this evening, we are all here at the Harvard Law
School Forum together: both races, face to face. During
the next few moments we can question and examine for
ourselves the wisdom or the folly of what Mr. Muhammad
is teaching.</p>

<p>Many of you who classify yourselves as &#8220;white&#8221; express
surprise and shock at this truth that Mr. Muhammad is
teaching among your 20 million ex-slaves here in America,
but you should be neither surprised nor shocked.</p>

<p>As students, scholars, professors and scientists you should
be well aware that we are living in a world and at a time
when great changes are taking place. New ideas are replacing
the old ones. Old governments are collapsing, and
new nations are being born. The entire &#8220;old system&#8221; which
has held the Old World together has lost its effectiveness,
and now that Old World is going out. A new system or
New World must replace the Old World.</p>

<p>Just as the old ideas must be removed to make way for
the new, God has declared to Mr. Muhammad that the
evil features of this wicked Old World must be exposed,
faced up to, and removed in order to make way for the
New World that God Himself is getting ready to establish.</p>

<p>The Divine Mission of Mr. Muhammad here in America
today is to prepare us for this New World of Righteousness,
by delivering to us a message that will give us a
better understanding of this Old World&#8217;s many defects ...
and then we will all agree that God must remove this
wicked Old World.</p>

<p>We see by reports in the daily press that even many of
you who are scholars and scientists think that this message
of Islam that is being taught here in America among your
20 million ex-slaves is &#8220;new,&#8221; or that it is something Mr.
Muhammad himself has made up.</p>

<p>Mr. Muhammad&#8217;s religious message is not &#8220;new.&#8221; All of
the scientists and prophets of old predicted that a man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
such as he, with a doctrine or message such as this that
Mr. Muhammad is spreading among your 20 million ex-slaves,
would make his appearance among us at a time
such as we are living in today.</p>

<p>It is also written in your own scriptures that this prophetic
figure would not be raised up from the midst of the
educated class, but that God would make His choice of a
man from among the lowly, uneducated, downtrodden and
oppressed masses ... among the lowest element of America&#8217;s
20 million ex-slaves.</p>

<p>Just as it was in the days when God raised up Moses
from among the lowly Hebrew slaves, and missioned him
to separate his oppressed people from a slave master
named Pharaoh, and Moses found himself opposed by the
scholars and scientists of that day, who are symbolically
described in the bible as &#8220;Pharaoh&#8217;s Magicians.&#8221;...</p>

<p>And just as Jesus, himself a lowly carpenter, was also
missioned by God in that day to find his people (the &#8220;lost
sheep&#8221;) and separate them from their Gentile enemies, and
restore them back among their own people ... Jesus also
found himself opposed by the scholars and scientists of
his day, who are symbolically described in the bible as
&#8220;scribes, priests, and pharisees.&#8221;</p>

<p>Just as the learned class of those days disagreed and
opposed both Moses and Jesus primarily because of their
humble origin and status, today Mr. Elijah Muhammad is
likewise being opposed by the learned, educated intellectuals
from among his own kind primarily because of his
humble origin and status in their eyesight, and efforts are
made by these modern-day &#8220;magicians, scribes, and Pharisees&#8221;
to ridicule Mr. Muhammad by magnifying the humble
origin of his many followers.</p>

<p>Moses was raised up among his enslaved people at a
time when God was planning to remove the power of the
slave master and bring about a great change by placing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
the slaves in a land of their own where they could give
birth to a &#8220;New Civilization,&#8221; completely independent of
their former slave master. Pharaoh opposed God&#8217;s plan and
God&#8217;s servant, so Pharaoh and his people were destroyed.</p>

<p>Jesus was sent among his people again at a time when
God was planning to bring about a great change. The new
dispensation preached by Jesus 2,000 years ago ushered in
a new type of civilization, the Christian civilization, better
known as the Christian world.</p>

<p>The Holy Prophet Muhammad (may the peace and
blessings of ALLAH be upon him) came 600 years after
Jesus with another dispensation that did not destroy or
remove the Christian civilization, but it did put a dent in
it, a wound that has lasted even until today.</p>

<p>Now today, God has sent Mr. Elijah Muhammad among
the downtrodden and oppressed so-called American Negroes
to warn us that God is again about to bring about
another great change ... only this time, it will be a FINAL
CHANGE! This is the day and the time for a COMPLETE
CHANGE.</p>

<p>Mr. Muhammad is teaching that the religion of Islam is
the only solution to the problems confronting our people
here in America, but he also warns us that it is even more
important for us to know the base or foundation of that
which we must build upon tomorrow.</p>

<p>Therefore, the way in which Mr. Muhammad teaches us
the religion of Islam, and the particular kind of Islam he
teaches us, may appear to be different from that which is
taught in the Old World of Islam, but the basic principles
and practices are the same.</p>

<p>You must remember: the condition of America&#8217;s 20 million
ex-slaves is uniquely pitiful. But, just as the old religious
leaders in the days of Moses and Jesus refused
to accept Moses and Jesus as religious reformers, today
many of the religious leaders in the Old Muslim World<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
may also refute the teachings of Mr. Elijah Muhammad
... not realizing the unique condition of these 20 million
ex-slaves, and by not understanding that Mr. Elijah Muhammad&#8217;s
teachings are divinely prescribed to rectify the
miserable condition of our oppressed people here ... but
as God made Pharaoh&#8217;s Magicians bow before Moses, and
the Scribes and Pharisees bow before Jesus ... it is God&#8217;s
plan today to make all opposition (both at home and
abroad) bow before this truth that is now being taught by
The Honorable Elijah Muhammad.</p>

<p>We are 4,000 years from the time of that great change
which took place in Moses&#8217; day ... we are 2,000 years
from the time of that great change that took place in Jesus&#8217;
day ... and if you will but look around you on this earth
today it will be as clear as the five fingers on your hand
that we are again living at the time of a great change right
now.</p>

<p>God has come to close out the entire Old World ... the
Old World in which for the past 6,000 years practically
the entire earth has been deceived, conquered, colonized,
ruled, enslaved, oppressed and exploited by the CAUCASIAN
RACE.</p>

<p>When Pharaoh&#8217;s civilization had reached its peak, and
his time to rule over the slaves was up, God appeared
unto Moses and revealed to him that He had something
different for his people. Likewise, God has told Mr. Muhammad
that He has something different for his People
(the so-called Negroes) here in America today, something
that up until now has never before been revealed ... Mr.
Muhammad teaches us that this Old World has seen nothing
yet ... the REAL THING is yet to come.</p>

<p>The Black Muslims who follow Mr. Muhammad are not
only making our exit out of the door of the Old World,
but the door to the New World is yet to be opened ...
and what is inside that door is yet to be revealed.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>This present teaching of Mr. Muhammad among your
20 million ex-slaves is only to prepare us to walk out of
this wicked Old World in as intelligent, pleasant, and
peaceful a way as is possible.</p>

<p>This present teaching among the so-called American
Negroes is designed only to show proof to us why we
should give up this wicked Old House. The roof is leaking;
the walls are collapsing, and we find it is no longer
able to support the tremendous weight caused by our continued
presence in it.</p>

<p>And since the knowledge of the deterioration and eventual
collapse of this Old Building has come to Mr. Muhammad
from Almighty God Himself, whose proper name
is ALLAH, the Lord of all the Worlds, the Master of the
Judgment Day ... The Honorable Elijah Muhammad is
pointing these dangerous present conditions and future
events out to you who have enslaved us, as well as to us.</p>

<p>With the proper support and guidance our people can
get out of this sagging Old Building before it collapses.</p>

<p>But this support and guidance that we need actually consists
of being taught: a thorough knowledge of the origin,
history and nature of the Caucasian race, as well as a
thorough knowledge of our own black nation. We must
have a knowledge of the true origin and history and the
white man&#8217;s Christian religion, as well as an understanding
of the Islamic religion that prevails primarily among our
brothers and sisters in Africa and Asia.</p>

<p>You will probably ask us: Why then, if this Old House
is going to collapse or go up in smoke, are the Black Muslims
asking for some states to be set aside for us right
here in this country ... it&#8217;s like asking for a chance to
retain rooms in a house that you claim is doomed for total
destruction?</p>

<p>God is giving America every opportunity to repent and
atone for the crime she committed when she enslaved our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
people, just as God gave Pharaoh a chance to repent before
He finally destroyed him because he was too proud
to free his slaves and give them complete justice.</p>

<p>We are asking you for territory here only because of
the great opposition we receive from this government in
our efforts to awaken our people, unite them, separate
them from their oppressors, and return them to our own
land and people.</p>

<p>You should never make the drastic mistake of thinking
that Mr. Muhammad has no place to take his followers in
the World of Islam. No sir! He is not shut out there like
many of you wish to believe. All who accept Islam and
follow him have been offered a home in the Muslim World.</p>

<p>Our people have been oppressed and exploited here in
America for 400 years, and now with Mr. Muhammad we
can leave this wicked land of bondage, but our former
slave master is yet opposing his efforts and is unjustly persecuting
his followers who have left the Christian church
and accepted the religion of Islam.</p>

<p>This is further proof that our Caucasian slave master
does not want us or trust us to leave him and live elsewhere
on this earth, and yet if we stay here among them
he continues to keep us at the very lowest level of his
society.</p>

<p>Pick up any daily paper or magazine and examine the
anti-Muslim propaganda and the false charges leveled
against our beloved religious leader by some of America&#8217;s
leading reporters. This only points up the fact that the
Caucasian race is never willing to let any black man who
is not their puppet or parrot speak for our people or lead
our people out of their enslaving clutches without giving
him great opposition.</p>

<p>The Caucasian slave master has opposed all such leaders
in the past, and even today he sanctions and supports only
those Negro spokesmen who parrot his doctrines, his ideas<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
... or those who accept his so-called &#8220;advice&#8221; on how our
people should carry on our struggle against his 400 years
of tyranny.</p>

<p>The Christian world has failed to give the black man
justice. This Christian government has failed to give 20
million ex-slaves justice for our 310 years of free slave
labor. Despite this, we have been better Christians even
than those who taught us Christianity. We have been
America&#8217;s most faithful servants during peace time, and
her bravest soldiers during war time. And still, white Christians
have been unable to recognize us and accept us as
fellow human beings. Today we can see that the Christian
religion of the Caucasian race has failed us. Thus the black
masses are turning away from the church back to the religion
of Islam.</p>

<p>The government sends its agents among our people to
tell lies: they have a well-organized all-out effort to harass
them, in an effort to frighten those of our people in this
country who wish to accept the religion of Islam, and
unite under the spiritual guidance and divine leadership
of The Honorable Elijah Muhammad.</p>

<p>Therefore, Mr. Muhammad has declared to you, and to
your government, that if you don&#8217;t want your 20 million
ex-slaves to leave you and return to our own land and
people ... and since your actions have proved that the
Caucasian race will not accept these 20 million ex-slaves
here among them as complete equals ... then let us separate
ourselves from you right here, into a separate territory
that we can call our own, and on which we can do something
for ourselves and for our own kind.</p>

<p>Since we cannot live among the Caucasians in peace,
and there is not enough time left for us (this new Negro)
to wait for the Caucasian race to be &#8220;re-educated&#8221; and
freed of their racial prejudices, and their inbred beliefs
and practices of white supremacy ... I repeat: Let our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
people be separated from you, and give us some territory
here that we can call our own, and live in peace among
ourselves.</p>

<p>According to recent news dispatches appearing in daily
papers throughout this nation: In prisons all over the country
the wardens are unjustly persecuting the inmates who
want to change from the Christian religion and accept the
religion of Islam and follow the spiritual guidance of The
Honorable Elijah Muhammad.</p>

<p>These prison wardens even admit that when the inmates
change from Christianity to Islam they become model
prisoners, but despite this they are being persecuted and
prevented from reading the Holy Quran, the same Holy
Book that is read daily by hundreds of millions of our
darker brothers and sisters in Africa and Asia.</p>

<p>When the true facts about this religious persecution are
made known among the 725 million Muslims in the World
of Islam, that strategic area that stretches from the China
Seas to the shores of West Africa, how do you think the
American Caucasians will then look in the eyes of those
non-white people there?</p>

<p>The very fact that there is a concerted effort against
Islam by wardens across the country is proof that the
American government is trying to stamp out the religion
of Islam here in a frantic effort to keep it from spreading
among her 20 million ex-slaves whom she continues to
confine to the lowly role of second-class citizenship.</p>

<p>Further proof of this is the fact that these 20 million
so-called Negroes have never even been taught about the
religion of Islam during the entire 400 years since the
Caucasian first brought our people here away from our
African Muslim culture in chains ... and despite the
fact that Islam is, and always has been, the prevailing religion
among our people in Africa.</p>

<p>Now the American Caucasian, in a last act of desperation,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
is accusing Mr. Muhammad of not being a true Muslim,
and of not teaching true Islam. If the American
Caucasian knows so much about true Islam, and has suddenly
become such an authority on it, why hasn&#8217;t he taught
it to his 20 million ex-slaves before now?</p>

<p>Also, the American Caucasian today loves to print glaring
headlines saying that the orthodox Muslims don&#8217;t recognize
or accept Mr. Muhammad and his Black Muslims
as true Muslims.</p>

<p>&#8220;Divide and rule&#8221; has long been the Caucasian strategy
to continue their colonization of dark people. The American
Caucasian actually has colonized 20 million black
people here in this country simply by dividing us from
our African brothers and sisters for 400 years, converting
us to his Christian religion, and then by teaching us to call
ourselves &#8220;Negroes&#8221; ... and telling us we were no longer
African ... (I guess he says this because our exposure
to this &#8220;superior&#8221; white culture makes us &#8220;different&#8221; ...
so-called &#8220;civilized.&#8221;)</p>

<p>As hundreds of thousands of the ex-slaves here in America
today refuse to attend the church of the Caucasians
who enslaved us, shunning all further use of the word
&#8220;Negro,&#8221; and because we are accepting ALLAH as our
God, Islam as our religion, and The Honorable Elijah
Muhammad as our religious leader and teacher ... now
the Americans who enslaved us are reverting back to the
old trick of their fellow colonialists ... &#8220;divide and rule&#8221;
... by trying to separate us from the Muslim World,
thinking that they can in this way alienate us from our
people in Africa and Asia who also serve and follow Almighty
God, ALLAH.</p>

<p>There are probably 100,000 of what you (whites) call
orthodox Muslims in America, who were born in the Muslim
World, and who willingly migrated here. But, despite
the fact that Islam is a propagating religion, all of these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
foreign Muslims combined have not been successful in
converting 1,000 Americans to Islam.</p>

<p>On the other hand, they see that Mr. Muhammad, all
by himself, has hundreds of thousands of his fellow ex-slaves
turning Eastward toward Mecca five times daily
giving praises to the Great God ALLAH.</p>

<p>No true Muslim, in his right mind, would denounce or
deny this meek and humble little black man, who was
himself born in Georgia, the very worst part of this country,
as a leader, a defender of the faith, a propagator of
the faith, who has rekindled the light of Islam here in the
West.</p>

<p>His Caucasian opposers have never gotten even one responsible
Muslim official to criticize or denounce Mr.
Muhammad. They succeed only in getting some jealous
or envious little peddler or merchant who migrated here
and wants to be recognized as some sort of leader himself,
and who will therefore accept the Caucasian&#8217;s thirty pieces
of silver to attack this man of God.</p>

<p>How would Mr. Muhammad ever make a trip into the
forbidden areas of Arabia, and visit the Holy Cities of
Mecca and Medina ... being welcomed and honored by
its most respected religious leaders ... the great Imams
themselves ... if he himself was not recognized as a great
religious man, and a man of God, doing miraculous works
by spreading ALLAH&#8217;s name here in the West among the
20 million ex-slaves of America?</p>

<p>How could Mr. Muhammad visit the capitals of the
Muslim World, and be received by its respected leaders,
if he too was not recognized and respected as a Muslim
leader by them?</p>

<p>He visited Al-Azhar, the oldest Mosque and Muslim
University in the world, and had tea with the Chief Imam,
the Grand Sheikh Shaltuat, who kissed him on his forehead
in true Muslim fashion ... yet the American Caucasians,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
hoping to block his success among our people,
continue to oppose him and say he is not a true Muslim.</p>

<p>Again you will say: Why then don&#8217;t he and his followers
leave this house of bondage right now, and go and
live in the Muslim World? All of the Black Muslims can
live in the Muslim World tomorrow, but The Honorable
Elijah Muhammad wants justice for the entire 20 million
so-called Negroes.</p>

<p>You and your Christian government make the problem
even more complicated. You don&#8217;t want your 20 million
ex-slaves to leave you, yet you won&#8217;t share equal justice
with them right here.</p>

<p>Since you don&#8217;t want them to leave this country with us,
and you won&#8217;t give them equal justice among your kind
... then we will agree only if you let us separate ourselves
from you right here.</p>

<p>Just give us a portion of this country that we can call
our own. Put us in it. Then give us everything we need to
start our own civilization here ... that is, support us for
20 to 25 years, until we are able to go for ourselves. This
is God&#8217;s plan. This is God&#8217;s solution. This is justice, and
compensation for our 310 years of free slave labor.</p>

<p>Otherwise America will reap the full fury of God&#8217;s wrath,
for her crimes against our people here are many. As your
bible says: &#8220;He that leads into captivity shall go into
captivity; he that kills with the sword shall be killed by
the sword.&#8221; This is the law of justice and this is in your
own Christian scriptures.</p>

<p>The black masses are shaking off the drugs, or narcotic
effect of the token integration promises. A cup of tea in
a white restaurant is not sufficient compensation for 310
years of free slave labor. The black masses as represented
by the Black Muslims will never be satisfied until we have
some land that we can call our own.</p>

<p>Again I repeat: we are not asking for territory here<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
because Mr. Muhammad has no place else to take us. But,
to benefit the entire 20 million so-called Negroes, 20 million
ex-slaves, who, despite the fact that the Emancipation
Proclamation was issued 100 years ago.... These oppressed
people are still begging their former slave master
for recognition as human beings ... therefore, Mr. Muhammad
is asking this government to stop toying with our
people, stop fooling them year in and year out with false
promises of token integration.</p>

<p>Token integration will not solve our problem. This is a
false solution. A &#8220;token&#8221; solution. It is a hypocritical approach
to the problem, a tricky scheme devised by you,
and propagated by your Negro puppets whom you yourself
have appointed as our &#8220;leaders&#8221; and &#8220;spokesmen.&#8221;</p>

<p>Integration is not good for either side. It will destroy
your race, and your government knows it will also destroy
ours ... and the problem will still remain unsolved.</p>

<p>God has declared that these 20 million ex-slaves must
have a home of their own. After 400 years here among the
Caucasians, we are absolutely convinced that we can never
live together in peace, unless we are willing to remain
subservient to our former masters ... therefore, immediate
and complete separation is the only solution.</p>

<p>NAACP Attorney Thurgood Marshall has admitted publicly
that six years since the Supreme Court decision on
DESEGREGATION of the schools, only 6 per cent desegregation
has taken place. This is an example of integration!</p>

<p>A kidnaper, a robber, an enslaver, a lyncher is just another
common criminal in the sight of God, and the above-mentioned
criminal acts have been committed on a mass
scale for 400 years by your race against America&#8217;s 20 million
so-called Negroes.</p>

<p>It is true that today America professes to be sorry for
her crimes against our people, and she says she wants to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
repent, and in her desire to atone or make amends she
offers her 20 million ex-slaves flowery promises of &#8220;token&#8221;
integration.</p>

<p>Many of these downtrodden victims want to forgive
America; they want to forget the crimes you have committed
against them, and some are even willing to accept
the formula of &#8220;token integration&#8221; that you yourself have
devised as the solution to correct the problems created by
your criminal acts against them.</p>

<p>In a court of justice the criminal can confess his crimes
and throw himself on the mercy of the court if he has truly
repented, but neither the criminal nor his victims have
any say-so in suggesting the sentence that is to be passed
upon the guilty ... or the price that the confessed criminal
must pay. This is left in the hands of the Judge. We are
living in the Day of Judgment right now. God is the Judge
that our American slave master must now answer to.</p>

<p>God is striking this great country with tornadoes, storms,
floods, rain, hail, snow ... and terrific earthquakes are yet
to come. Your people are being afflicted with increasing
epidemics of illness and disease, divine plagues that God
is striking you with because of your criminal acts against
the 20 million ex-slaves ... and today instead of repenting
and truly compensating our people for their 310 years of
free slave labor that built up this great country for you, you
buy out the Negro leaders with 30 pieces of silver and get
them to sell our people on accepting your &#8220;token integration.&#8221;</p>

<p>When one uses a &#8220;token&#8221; on the bus or streetcar that
&#8220;token&#8221; is a substitute for the real money. Token means
&#8220;a substitute,&#8221; that which takes the place of the real thing.</p>

<p>Token integration takes the place of the real thing. Two
black students at Georgia University is TOKEN integration.
Four black children in New Orleans white schools is
TOKEN integration. A handful of black students in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
white schools in Little Rock is TOKEN integration. None
of this is REAL integration; it is only a pacifier designed
to keep these awakening black babies from crying too
loud.</p>

<p>The white man&#8217;s violent rebellion, and relentless struggle
against TOKEN integration is sufficient to prove what
would happen if the Negro leaders demanded REAL INTEGRATION.</p>

<p>Also, according to the above-mentioned rate of speed
since the desegregation decisions of the Supreme Court, it
will take us another thousand years to get the white man
in the South sufficiently &#8220;re-educated&#8221; to accept our people
in their midst as equals ... and if the rest of the truth is
told, it will also take the white man here in the North, West
and East just as long as his brother in the South ... if the
frightened Uncle Tom leadership ever stops accepting his
master&#8217;s &#8220;tokens&#8221; and begins to demand the real thing.</p>

<p>To many of you here at the Harvard Law School Forum
this evening, this sounds ridiculous; to some it even sounds
insane. But these 20 million black people here in America
now number a nation in their own right. Do you believe
a nation within another nation can be successful? Especially
when they both have equal education?</p>

<p>Once the slave has his master&#8217;s education, the slave wants
to be like his master, wants to share his master&#8217;s property,
and even wants to exercise the same privileges as his master
even while he is yet in his master&#8217;s house.</p>

<p>This is the CORE of America&#8217;s troubles today; and there
will be no peace for America as long as 20 million so-called
Negroes are here BEGGING for the rights which America
knows she will never grant us.</p>

<p>Even this limited education America has granted her
ex-slaves has already produced great unrest ... and Almighty
God says the only way for America to ever have
any future peace or prosperity is for her 20 million ex-slaves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
to be SEPARATED from her ... and it is for this
reason that Mr. Muhammad teaches us that we must have
some land of our own.</p>

<p>If we receive equal education, how long do you expect
us to remain your passive servants, or second-class citizens?
There is no such thing as a second-class citizen. We
are FULL CITIZENS or we are not citizens at all.</p>

<p>When you teach a man the science of government he
wants an equal part (or position) in that government ...
or else he wants a government himself. He begins to demand
equality with his master.</p>

<p>No man with equal education will serve you. The only
way you can continue to rule us is with a superior knowledge,
or by continuing to withhold equal education from
our people.</p>

<p>America has not given us equal education, but she has
given us enough to make us want more ... and to make
us demand equality of opportunity ... and this is causing
unrest ... plus international embarrassment ... thus the
only solution is immediate SEPARATION.</p>

<p>As your colleges and universities turn out an ever increasing
number of so-called Negro graduates with education
equal to yours, they will automatically increase their demands
for equality in EVERYTHING else. This equal education
will increase their spirit of equality and make them
feel that they should have EVERYTHING that you have,
and their increasing demands will become a perpetual
headache for you ... and continue to cause you international
embarrassment.</p>

<p>In fact, the same Negro students you are turning out
today will soon be demanding the same things you now
hear being demanded by Mr. Muhammad and the Black
Muslims.</p>

<p>In my conclusion: I must remind you that since your own
Christian bible states that God is coming in the &#8220;last days,&#8221;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
or at the &#8220;end of the Old World,&#8221; and that God&#8217;s coming
would bring about a GREAT SEPARATION ... and since
we see all sorts of signs throughout the earth that indicate
that THE TIME OF GOD&#8217;S COMING is upon us ... why
don&#8217;t you repent while there is yet time?</p>

<p>Do justice by your faithful ex-slaves. Give us some land
of our own right here, some SEPARATE STATES, so we
can separate ourselves from you ... then everyone will be
satisfied, and perhaps we will all be able to then live happily
ever after, as your own Christian bible says ... &#8220;every
one under his own vine and fig tree.&#8221;</p>

<p>Otherwise: all of you who are sitting here, your government,
and your entire race will be destroyed and removed
from this earth by Almighty God, ALLAH. I thank you.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">3. MALCOLM X<br />

ON &#8220;UNITY&#8221;</h3></div>


<p><i>Malcolm X delivered this speech at a so-called &#8220;unity&#8221; rally
on the streets of Harlem early in the spring of 1960. As the
text indicates, politics was in the air, and the Black Muslims
were calling for &#8220;unity&#8221; among Negro leaders.</i></p>

<p><i>The stage was set for the rally when the Black Muslims
telegraphed some fifteen outstanding Negro leaders, asking
them to participate in the affair. None of them came, but
this did not stop Malcolm X from unburdening himself.
Here again we see Malcolm X on the defensive, but in a
somewhat different way. In the first half of the speech
Malcolm is pulling in his horns; he is saying &#8220;unity,&#8221; &#8220;freedom,&#8221;
&#8220;peace.&#8221; He is suggesting a summit meeting of Negro
leaders. &#8220;Let&#8217;s have our arguments behind closed doors,&#8221;
Malcolm shouts, &#8220;but let&#8217;s come out unified.&#8221;</i></p>

<p><i>At that juncture, however, nobody was willing to practice
summitry with the Black Muslims.</i></p>

<p><i>Malcolm used this speech to point up the Black Muslim
concern for morality; he attacks the dope, crime, and prostitution</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
<i>of Harlem as well as those&mdash;black and white&mdash;who
thrive upon these evils.</i></p>

<p><i>As expected, Malcolm concludes with the call for a separate
state; he restates his Harvard offer: the white race can
be spared from destruction if they give the Negro a separate
state.</i></p>

<p><i>The rally lasted five hours; thirteen black nationalist
groups were represented, and some four thousand people
blocked off 125th Street and Seventh Avenue at the peak
of the rally.</i></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">As-salaam-alaikum, beloved brothers and sisters, welcome
to our harlem freedom rally.</span></p>

<p>When we say &#8220;our&#8221; we do not mean Muslim nor Christian,
Catholic nor Protestant, Baptist nor Methodist, Democrat
nor Republican, Mason nor Elk. By &#8220;our&#8221; Harlem
Freedom, we mean the black people of Harlem, the black
people of America, and the black people all over this earth.</p>

<p>The largest concentration of black people on earth is
right here in Harlem, so we are gathered here today in
Harlem Square to a Freedom Rally, of black people, by
black people, and for the benefit of black people.</p>

<p>We are not here at this Rally because we have already
gained freedom. No! We are gathered here rallying for the
freedom which we have long been promised, but have as
yet not received. This Rally is for that perfect freedom
which up until now this government has not granted us.
There would be no need to protest to the government if we
were already free.</p>

<p>Freedom is essential to life itself. Freedom is essential
to the development of the human being. If we don&#8217;t have
freedom we can never expect justice and equality. Only
after we have freedom do justice and equality become a
reality.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>Today we are gathered at this Rally to hear from our
leaders who have been acting as our spokesmen, and representing
us to the white man downtown. We want to know
how our leaders really think, how they talk, how they feel
... and most important of all, we want them to know how
we feel.</p>

<p>Many of these leaders have suddenly become &#8220;experts
on Harlem&#8221; and as such are often regarded by the white
man as the &#8220;voice of Harlem.&#8221; If this must be the case,
then we want the voice of these leaders to ring sometimes
in Harlem too.</p>

<p>Leaders have differences, and these differences ofttimes
cause serious division among the masses. But the HOUR is
too short today for black people to afford the luxury of
&#8220;differences.&#8221;</p>

<p>Again I repeat, we are not gathered here today because
we are Muslims or Christians, Protestants or Catholics,
Baptists or Methodists, Democrats or Republicans, Masons
or Elks ... but because as a collective mass of black
people we have been colonized, enslaved, lynched, exploited,
deceived, abused, etc.</p>

<p>As a collective mass of black people we have been deprived,
not only of civil rights, but even our human rights,
the right to human dignity ... the right to be a human
being!</p>

<p>This Freedom Rally is to be a united effort by all our
leaders. We have set aside all petty differences, and in the
Spirit of Bandung we have come together on this same
platform, wherein each one can voice his personal feelings
and his personal solution to this grave crisis we face.</p>

<p>The Western World today faces a great catastrophe. It
stands on the brink of disaster. Mr. Muhammad says the
only way our people can avoid the fiery destruction that
God Himself will soon unleash upon this wicked world is
for our people to come together among themselves in unity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
and practice true brotherhood. Mr. Muhammad says God
is with us to unite our people into one brotherhood, and
to aid those that are oppressed, and to uplift those who are
downtrodden.</p>

<p>The Western World, filled with evil and wickedness, is
groping and stumbling blindly through spiritual darkness
toward its inevitable doom. Mr. Muhammad says we must
qualify ourselves so that God&#8217;s spiritual light will guide us
past the pitfalls of destruction.</p>

<p>The Western World is filled with drunkenness, dope
addiction, lying, stealing, gambling, adultery, fornication,
prostitution and hosts of other evils. These evils must be
removed if the world is to have peace. These evils are the
primary cause of troubles all over the earth. These evils
promote greed and lust, increase wickedness and unrest,
and destroy all hopes for peace.</p>

<p>You want peace. I want peace. Everyone craves for a
world of peace. Mr. Muhammad says anyone who will submit
to the God of Peace will have peace. Even the white
man himself can prolong his time today if he will submit
to the God of Peace, and give freedom, justice, and equality
to the &#8220;people of God&#8221; ... the so-called Negroes here in
America.</p>

<p>The city of Nineveh in the bible to whom Jonah was sent
to warn is a good prophetic example of today. They were
actually spared because they repented when the warning
came to them from God. God will spare our slave master
today too if he will repent.</p>

<p>The whole dark world wants peace. When I was in Africa
last year I was deeply impressed by the desire of our
African Brothers for peace, but even they agree that there
can be no peace without freedom from colonialism, foreign
domination, oppression and exploitation.</p>

<p>The God of Peace and Righteousness is about to set up
His kingdom of peace and righteousness here on this earth.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
Knowing that God is about to establish His righteous government,
Mr. Muhammad is trying to clean up our morals
and qualify us to enter into this new righteous nation of
God.</p>

<p>The American so-called Negroes must recognize each
other as brothers and sisters ... stop carrying guns and
knives to harm each other, stop drinking whiskey, taking
dope, reefers, and even cigarettes. No more gambling! Save
your money. Stop fornication, adultery and prostitution.
Elevate the black woman; respect her and protect her. Let
us rid ourselves of immoral habits and God will be with us
to protect and guide us.</p>

<p>Then, we must form a platform that will be good for all
of our own people, as well as for others. As black people we
must unite. We must recognize and give intelligent active
support to our political leaders who fight for us unselfishly,
sincerely, and fearlessly.</p>

<p>But, to prove their sincerity and their right for the support
of the black masses, these leaders must first display
fearlessness, intelligence, and unity among themselves.
They must stop their public bickering with each other.
They must stop attacking each other in front of the white
man, and for the benefit of the white man.</p>

<p>If the black leaders must have differences of opinion,
learn to go into the closet with each other, but when you
come from behind closed doors, show a united front in the
face of the one who is a common enemy to all of us.</p>

<p>Mr. Muhammad has invited all of the leaders here today
for that purpose. He wants our people united, but unity
will never exist among the black masses as long as our
leaders are not united.</p>

<p>We want to get behind leaders who will fight for us ...
leaders who are not afraid to demand freedom, justice, and
equality. We do not want leaders who are hand picked for
us by the white man. We don&#8217;t want any more Uncle Toms.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
We don&#8217;t want any more leaders who are puppets or parrots
for the white man.</p>

<p>We want brave leaders as our spokesmen, who are not
afraid to state our case, who can intelligently demand what
we need, what we want, and what is rightfully ours. We
don&#8217;t want leaders who are beggars, who feel they must
compromise with the enemy. And we don&#8217;t want leaders
who are selfish or greedy ... who will sell us out for a few
pieces of silver.</p>

<p>A big election is coming up this year. What kind of leaders
do we want in office? Which ones will the black masses
get behind? Mr. Muhammad has thousands of followers,
and millions of sympathizers. He will place his weight behind
any fearless black leaders who will stand up and help
the so-called American Negroes get complete and immediate
freedom.</p>

<p>If these black leaders are afraid that to be identified with
us they will irk the white man, or lose the white man&#8217;s
favor or his support, then they can no longer expect the
support of the black masses.</p>

<p>They call us racial extremists. They call Jomo Kenyatta
also a racial extremist and Tom Mboya a moderate. It is
only the white man&#8217;s fear of men like Kenyatta that makes
him listen to men like Mboya. If it were not for the extremists,
the white man would ignore the moderates. To
be called a &#8220;moderate&#8221; in this awakening dark world today,
that is crying for freedom, is to receive the &#8220;kiss of death&#8221;
as spokesmen or leaders of the masses ... for the masses
are ready to burst the shackles of slavery whether the
&#8220;moderates&#8221; will stand up or not.</p>

<p>We have many black leaders who are unafraid, especially
when they know the black masses stand behind them.
Many of them are qualified to represent us not only in this
United States government, but could also represent us in
this government if we are given 100 per cent citizenship<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
and the opportunity for FIRST-CLASS participation ...
or else we can get behind these same leaders in setting up
an independent government of our own.</p>

<p>We, the black masses, don&#8217;t want these leaders who seek
our support coming to us representing a certain political
party. They must come to us today as black leaders representing
the welfare of black people.</p>

<p>We won&#8217;t follow any leader today who comes on the basis
of political party. Both parties (Democrat and Republican)
are controlled by the same people who have abused our
rights, and who have deceived us with false promises every
time an election rolls around.</p>

<p>Mr. Muhammad grieves over the disunity that exists even
among the intellectuals and professional so-called Negroes.
It is these &#8220;educated&#8221; so-called Negroes who should be
leading us out of this maze of misery and want. They possess
the academic know-how, great amounts of technical
skills ... but they can&#8217;t use it for the benefit of their own
kind simply because they themselves are also disunited.
If these intellectuals and professional so-called Negroes
would unite, not only Harlem would benefit, but it will
benefit our people all over the world.</p>

<p>Mr. Muhammad says disunity is our number one stumbling
block, and this disunity exists only because we lack
knowledge of SELF (our own kind). So-called Negro &#8220;intellectuals&#8221;
seem to think integration is the answer. But, is
it? &#8220;Integrate&#8221; means to become as one unit. How can these
&#8220;intellectuals&#8221; expect the white man to accept us into his
social unit, political unit, or economic unit when we are
not yet in unity (as a unit) among our own kind?</p>

<p>We, the Muslims, are for &#8220;Brotherhood,&#8221; but not for
integration! What is the difference? Brotherhood is based
on love, which automatically produces voluntary acts of
&#8220;sincere benevolence.&#8221; But integration produces hypocrisy.
It forces the white man to pose as a &#8220;liberal,&#8221; to be pretensive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
and false. Thus, &#8220;benevolent&#8221; acts which are &#8220;forced
by integration laws&#8221; are producing white hypocrites, and
reducing chances of creating a &#8220;mutual-working-agreement&#8221;
between the two races.</p>

<p>Your thirst for integration makes the white man think
you want only to marry his daughter. We (Muslims) who
follow Mr. Muhammad don&#8217;t think God ever intended for
black men to marry white women. Mr. Muhammad and his
followers are violently opposed to intermarriage.</p>

<p>This is conveniently and purposely misinterpreted by our
enemies to mean that we are anti-white, anti-Christian, and
anti-American (simply because we refuse to chase after the
white man&#8217;s women!). Let the white man keep his women,
and let us keep ours.</p>

<p>Some Negroes who love race-mixing, and want white
women, are angry at Mr. Muhammad because he teaches
against race-mixing ... so they slip around and make the
white man think we are anti-white. (I&#8217;m surprised that the
white man is dumb enough to believe these Uncle Toms,
who stoop so low, like JUDAS, to be stool pigeons against
their own kind.)</p>

<p>We have oceans of dark people on this earth: in Africa,
Asia, and even here in America. Our women are the most
beautiful, like a bouquet of flowers. Why should we chase
white women?</p>

<p>In this &#8220;changing&#8221; world today, what would we do married
to a white woman? Her people don&#8217;t want you in their
neighborhood around them, and our fast awakening people
don&#8217;t want you to bring her back into our neighborhood
any more to live around us. Thus, you both become a
&#8220;misfit&#8221; ... unwelcomed and unwanted in either society
... where can you go?</p>

<p>Because we Muslims look at this as it is and face reality
does not mean we are anti-white. We don&#8217;t want his white
mother, his white sister, nor his white daughter. We want<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
only an equal chance on this earth, but to have an equal
chance we must have the same thing the white man himself
needed before he could get this nation started ... WE
MUST HAVE SOME LAND OF OUR OWN!</p>

<p>Why do we want some land of our own? Because land is
essential to freedom. How else can 20 million black people
who now constitute a nation in our own right, a NATION
WITHIN A NATION, expect to survive forever in a land
where we are the last ones hired and the first ones fired ...
simply because we have no land of our own?</p>

<p>For over 400 years we have been very faithful to our
American slave masters. Now God is warning them through
Mr. Muhammad that they should be nice enough to give
us some land so we can separate ourselves from them and
get started for ourselves.</p>

<p>This is no more than what the white man should do. It
is in complete accord with the Christian religion. Their
bible says that when a slave is set free, his slave master
should give him something to help him get started on his
own ... never send him away empty-handed.</p>

<p>If the Hebrews in the bible numbered only 600,000 in
the land of their bondage, and God was concerned with
giving them freedom in a land of their own, a land &#8220;flowing
with milk and honey&#8221; ... then what about 20 million so-called
Negroes here in America, who have the &#8220;freedom&#8221;
only to look for a job?</p>

<p>Can you not see that our former &#8220;leaders&#8221; have been
fighting for the wrong thing ... the wrong kind of freedom?
Mr. Muhammad says we must have some land where
we can work hard for ourselves, make ourselves equal, and
live in dignity. Then and only then we won&#8217;t have to beg
the white man for the crumbs that fall occasionally from
his table. No one respects or appreciates a beggar.</p>

<p>Since we say Lincoln freed us, let us avail ourselves of
that freedom by uniting together and doing something for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
our own kind. But, we must have some of this earth. We
have been in America over 400 years. We have been so-called
&#8220;free&#8221; 100 years, and yet he still calls us &#8220;the white
man&#8217;s burden.&#8221;</p>

<p>We Muslims don&#8217;t want to be a burden on America any
longer. God has given Mr. Muhammad a divine message,
program, and solution. WE MUST HAVE SOME LAND!
The white man should be glad to give his loyal &#8220;slaves&#8221;
some land so we can get out of his way and go for ourselves.</p>

<p>We will then set up our own farms, factories, business,
and schools ... and show him how much we appreciate
the education he has given us, by using it to become self-sustaining
... economically and otherwise.</p>

<p>We want some land where we can create unity, harmony
and brotherhood ... and live together in peace. Since
America now sees that this false show of integration and
intermarriage will not work, she should make immediate
steps to set aside a few of these states for us, and put us
there to ourselves.</p>

<p>If America will repent and do this, God will overlook
some of our wicked deeds (as in the days of Nineveh) ...
but if America refuses to give Mr. Muhammad what God
instructed him to ask for ... then, like the biblical houses
of Egypt and Babylon (slave empires of the bible), God
will erase the American government and the entire race
that it favors and represents, from this planet ... and God
will then give the whole earth back to the original owners,
the black man!</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">4. MALCOLM X&#8217;s<br />
&#8220;UNIVERSITY SPEECH&#8221;</h3></div>


<p><i>The following is Malcolm X&#8217;s &#8220;university speech,&#8221; a long
lecture he used in the hope of converting students&mdash;particularly
Negroes&mdash;on various university campuses during 1961-1962.
It is of some interest that this speech was given at
Atlanta University, the great citadel of Negro learning in
the Deep South, and Dr. Lonnie Cross, chairman of the department
of mathematics, not only joined the movement
but became assistant to Jeremiah X, minister of the Atlanta
Temple.</i></p>

<p><i>This lecture contains a unique passage. It will be recalled
that in his Harvard speech Malcolm chastised Moslems
from the East who had migrated to America but failed to
gather converts. In this speech he goes further; in a stinging
passage Malcolm flatly accuses Moslems from the East
of attempting to turn &#8220;our slave masters&#8221; (the American
white man) into good Moslems. He accuses orthodox Moslems
of &#8220;passing us by&#8221; and attempting to proselytize the
foes of the Negro rather than the Negro himself.</i></p>

<p><i>This is without doubt the strongest position any Muslim</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
<i>has ever taken against the orthodox Moslem movement and
further underscores my contention that the Black Muslims
are not really concerned about orthodox Islam. They need
the façade of world-wide Islam, of course, but the Black
Muslim movement is a home-grown operation with home-grown
aims and ideas. Nowhere is that more clearly stated
than in this &#8220;university speech.&#8221;</i></p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="smcap">Islam</span>, the natural religion of black mankind, is sweeping
through and resurrecting black America like a &#8220;flaming
fire,&#8221; under the Divine Guidance of Messenger Elijah Muhammad.</p>

<p>Fools try to ignore facts, but wise men must face facts to
remain wise. Fools refuse to change from their silly ways
and beliefs, but the mental powers of the wise man encourage
mental flexibility and enable him to keep an OPEN
MIND. This gives him the ability to re-adjust himself
whenever it becomes necessary for a CHANGE.</p>

<p>As fast as added &#8220;light&#8221; increases the wise man&#8217;s ability
to understand, he changes his &#8220;course&#8221; or his &#8220;pace&#8221; according
to the newly revealed facts before him.</p>

<p>Fools, however, just blunder on, blindly, heedless of the
ever-changing conditions on the road over which they must
travel ... thus, the BLIND DRIVERS and their &#8220;cars&#8221;
usually end up in the DITCH.</p>

<p>In the past, the &#8220;religious roads&#8221; leading through black
America presented smooth sailing for the &#8220;Old Touring
Cars&#8221; (Churches) of Christianity. They met few obstacles
and had little opposition or competition. The &#8220;drivers&#8221;
(preachers) had it easy. Their &#8220;course&#8221; was never challenged.
They ruled supreme on the religious roads of black
America.</p>

<p>However, today time is making a great CHANGE. The
religious roads of black America have suddenly become<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
blocked by a ROCKY BARRIER, and all the black and
white preachers combined are incapable of removing it.
The firm, down-to-earth, thought-provoking teachings of
the religion of Islam are now obstructing this path over
which it was once easy sailing for these preachers of white
man&#8217;s Christianity.</p>

<p>Islam poses both a challenge and a threat because Islam
is the &#8220;resurrecting power.&#8221; Thousands of so-called Negroes
are beginning for the first time to think for themselves, since
turning away from the segregated Christian church, and
are rejoining the ranks of their black brothers and sisters
of the East. Their age-old faith is the religion of Islam, the
religion of our foreparents, the true religion of black mankind.</p>

<p>The Spiritual Leader and Teacher of the many thousands
of &#8220;New Believers&#8221; here in black America is Messenger
Elijah Muhammad.</p>

<p>Before we heard the teachings of Messenger Muhammad,
we (American so-called Negroes) were in the grave
of ignorance. We had been taught by our Christian slave
master, as well as by our own ignorant religious leaders,
that God had cursed us black and sentenced us to a lifetime
of servitude to the Christian white race.</p>

<p>The same slave master&#8217;s Christian religion promised us
that we (Negroes) would sprout wings after death and fly
up into the sky where God would have a place especially
prepared for us.</p>

<p>Since we poor &#8220;cursed&#8221; slaves were not to get anything
on earth while we were alive, we soon learned to expect it
only after death, &#8220;up in the sky.&#8221; Thus, this earth, and all
its vast riches which we ourselves originally owned, was
left to the deceitful maneuverings of the white race, for
them to build a heaven for themselves and their own kind
&#8220;in THIS life.&#8221;</p>

<p>Such religious teachings were purposely designed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
make us (so-called Negroes) feel inferior to the white
Christian slave master. Soon he was successful in making
us fear him, obey him, and worship him ... instead of the
true Supreme Being, the God of our own foreparents, Almighty
God, ALLAH.</p>

<p>Messenger Muhammad has taught us how we eventually
became like the beggar Lazarus of the bible (Luke 16:20):
Our condition became very sore. We sat here amid the
rubbish of the Western World, at the feet of the rich, white
Christians ... begging for the crumbs (civil rights and
token integration) to fall from their table. But from this
very same slave master whom our foreparents had made
rich, by giving freely of their slave labor for nearly 400
years (Gen. 15:13), we received only the hardest and dirtiest
jobs at the lowest wages; the poorest houses in the
ghettos at the highest rent; the poorest food and clothing
at the highest prices. Our schools were like shacks, and
were staffed by teachers who knew and could teach only
that which the slave master dictated to them.</p>

<p>Messenger Muhammad has taught us how we (so-called
Negroes) were kidnaped from the East by the white Christian
slave master, brought to America in chains, and robbed
of our own God, His religion, our language, culture, names,
flag, and even our own nationality. After robbing us of all
that we originally could proudly call our own, then the
slave master taught us to call ourselves &#8220;Negroes.&#8221; He told
us that we were to be called &#8220;Negroes&#8221; because he found
us along the banks of the Niger River.</p>

<p>Messenger Muhammad asks us today: &#8220;Since when does
one&#8217;s nationality originate from a river?&#8221; This same slave
master taught us that &#8220;negro&#8221; means &#8220;black&#8221; in Spanish.
Messenger Muhammad again asks us why, then, do not the
dark, Spanish-speaking people in Spain, South and Central
America accept it (Negro) as their nationality too? Messenger
Muhammad says that we too should get our NATIONality<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
from the NATION that our foreparents originated
(as do all other recognized peoples).</p>

<p>The bible speaks of how we were purposely cut off from
our own kind after being robbed of our identity by the
cruel Christian slave master (Ezekiel 37:11; Psalms 137:1-9,
83:4). The slave master then took our names, language,
and religion from us so we would have to accept his, obey
him, and worship him (Dan. 1:6-7).</p>

<p>Messenger Muhammad has given us many scriptures to
prove his teachings to us are true and in accord with the
prophecies of the bible. He says it is we (so-called Negroes)
in America who were robbed and made deaf, dumb,
and blind to the knowledge of our own God and of our
own selves; so that today we are like DRY BONES IN THE
VALLEY (spiritually dead, and in a mental grave of ignorance).</p>

<p>We are now able to speak only the slave master&#8217;s tongue,
and are still being called the same &#8220;slave names&#8221; given to
our fathers during slavery by the slave master ... names
such as Jones, Smith, Powell, King, Bunche, Diggs, Dawson,
etc. These are all SLAVE NAMES, names of the very
same slave master who has shown characteristics of his
beast-like nature in his treatment of us. The original names
of our foreparents were cut off from them, kept secret from
us by the &#8220;beast&#8221; (Rev. 15:2), and therefore today we do
not know what our real names should be. We have really
been robbed!</p>

<p>All other people have their own religion, which teaches
them of a God with whom they themselves can associate. A
God who at least looks like one of their own kind. But, we
(so-called Negroes), after 400 years of masterful brainwashing
by the slave master, picture our &#8220;god&#8221; with the
same blond hair, pale skin, and cold blue eyes of our murderous
slave master.</p>

<p>His Christian religion teaches us that black is a curse;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
thus, we who accepted the slave master&#8217;s religion found
ourselves loving and respecting everything and everyone
except black, and could picture God as being anything else
but BLACK. In fact, many so-called Negroes would rather
believe that God is INVISIBLE, a &#8220;colorless spirit,&#8221; than
to admit even the possibility of his being black. Yet Daniel
saw Him with kinky hair (like lamb&#8217;s wool) in the seventh
chapter of Daniel, ninth verse. How grossly deceived we
have been!</p>

<p>Messenger Muhammad says that the teachers and religious
leaders of our own kind here in America were as
blind to the REAL TRUTH as we; therefore, they themselves
were not even qualified to lead us beyond that which
the slave master had falsely taught them. HOW CAN THE
BLIND LEAD THE BLIND? Thus, we remained in the
DITCH (the GRAVE of spiritual ignorance, mental bondage)
which was dug for us to fall into by our white Christian
slave master.</p>

<p>Not only did our own preachers and educators here fail
to give us the truth, our darker brothers who were born
in the East came here from the East and neglected to convert
us back to the original religion (ISLAM) of our foreparents.
Many of our brothers from the East even failed
to recognize us as their long-lost brothers (&#8220;lost sheep&#8221;)
who had been kidnaped from the Nation of Islam 400 years
ago, and made to dwell here in this strange land, among
these wicked people who are not of our own kind (Gen.
15:13), nor of our own choice.</p>

<p>Our brothers from the East passed us by, and instead,
tried to lecture on Islam to our slave master, thinking, so
foolishly, that they would be able to turn the slave master
into a righteous Muslim ... knowing all the time that the
same slave master was the very one who had kidnaped,
robbed, enslaved, and lynched (murdered) their long-lost
brothers. Yes, our brothers from the East came here and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
seemed to be apologists for Islam, instead of rightly spreading
it, or defending it from the sly insults of the unbelieving
slave master.</p>

<p>Messenger Muhammad teaches us that Almighty God,
ALLAH, is all-powerful and independent. ALLAH needs
no one to apologize for Him. Islam, His True Religion, is
not a religion of compromise. Islam is truth itself, and this
truth has long been kept a secret from us.</p>

<p>For 400 years, we (so-called Negroes) were deprived of
Islam (life) by our white slave master, who in turn indoctrinated
(brainwashed) us with his false religion of Christianity
... and like the biblical Lazarus, we soon became
so dead mentally and spiritually, that our attitude (disposition)
became offensive (stank) in the nostrils of the intelligent
and civilized world. Our kind in the East failed to
recognize us as their long-lost brothers (the lost sheep).
Our people in the East forgot us completely, and we, too,
soon forgot our blood-ties with them.</p>

<p>But Almighty God ALLAH forgets not. As He promised
in the Old Testament (Mal. 4:5) that He would send
ELIJAH to the &#8220;lost sheep&#8221; (the so-called Negroes of
America) in the &#8220;last days&#8221; (of the white man&#8217;s world), to
teach us the truth that would free us from our white slave
master, and turn our hearts and minds back toward our
own kind (our fathers in the East). And, in the last days of
this wicked world, the hearts of our people in the East
would be turned once again toward us (Isaiah 43:5).</p>

<p>We who have been raised by ELIJAH from the &#8220;grave&#8221;
that was dug for us by the slave master, bear witness that
this same ELIJAH, who was predicted to come, has been
raised from our midst today and is even now with us here
in America in the person of The Honorable Elijah Muhammad.
He is the &#8220;first begotten&#8221; from this grave of ignorance,
from the midst of we (so-called Negroes) who have long
been a mentally dead people. He is the &#8220;First Fruit&#8221; raised<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
from us who slept, and he has been raised from this grave
by Almighty God, ALLAH Himself.</p>

<p>Examine his works among us, for his works are sufficient
testimony to his identity. Only a fool, or an envious person,
would fail to see the greatness of this man after examining
his work. We who have been raised from the grave by him
bear witness of his work.</p>

<p>In a short time, Messenger Muhammad is accomplishing
what our educators and religious leaders here failed to do
for 100 years, and what our brothers from the East neglected
to do. Messenger Muhammad has brought our minds
out of the sky (where the ignorant preachers had sent it),
and has made us better able to face the reality of living.
He has restored life (truth) to our long-lost dead people.
Who else other than Almighty God, ALLAH, could have
given Messenger Muhammad the power to do what all
others have failed to do?</p>

<p>&#8220;And Allah sent down WATER from above, and therewith
gives life to the dead earth after its death. Surely
there is a SIGN in this for a people who listen.&#8221; (Quran 16:65.)</p>

<p>Praise be to ALLAH! Who would have believed it? An
ex-slave, a man like Moses (Deut. 18:18), to whom ALLAH
has given sufficient power to stand up and speak the truth
so boldly here in the land of our bondage, facing not only
the wrath of the wicked slave master (modern Pharaoh),
but also the wrath of his own kind, who are ignorant of the
truth. They are too blind to see what is good for them.
There are those also who are jealous and envious of his
Wisdom and his Divine Mission.</p>

<p>Messenger Muhammad&#8217;s teachings have really inspired
us with a thirst today for truth. We who follow him are
filled with an enthusiastic desire to wear the Crown of Life,
the jewels of which are: Wisdom, Knowledge, Understanding
... Freedom, Justice, Equality ... Food, Clothing,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
Shelter ... and Love, Peace, and Happiness. He teaches
us that these must be enjoyed while we are living.</p>

<p>These are the very essentials of life, and they adorn the
Crown of Life which we shall all wear in ALLAH&#8217;s Paradise,
the Kingdom of God, which shall soon be set up on
this earth, for us to enjoy while we are living.</p>

<p>Almighty God, ALLAH, has a religion of life, not of
death, that teaches us to live, the importance of living, and
how to live. ALLAH is the God of the living, and not the
God of the dead.</p>

<p>All praise is due to ALLAH! We who once followed foolishly
and blindly after the slave master&#8217;s plurality of gods
(TRINITY) and sought to have our heaven (the necessities
of life) up in the sky after we die, are no longer fooled
today by the slave master&#8217;s lies. Today, we know there is
but ONE GOD. There is no God but ALLAH! And, we
bear witness that The Honorable Elijah Muhammad is His
last and greatest Messenger to us here in North America.</p>

<p>Yes, we who were once dead (mentally, morally, socially,
politically, and economically), lying at the rich white
man&#8217;s feet here in the grave of ignorance, are being raised
today from this &#8220;death.&#8221; We are being made upright ...
PERPENDICULAR ... by the WORD of this Noble Messenger
of Almighty God, ALLAH. He has the Message of
Life for 20,000,000 so-called Negroes here in America.</p>

<p>&#8220;The people (Negroes) that walked in darkness (ignorance)
have seen a great light (Islam): they that dwell in
the land (of bondage) in the shadow of death (the Cross)
upon them has the light shined&#8221; (Isaiah 9:2).</p>

<p>Examine our previous condition, then judge Messenger
Muhammad according to his work among us. We who are
striving to carry his teachings into practice today are well
on the road to mental, moral and financial independence.</p>

<p>Thanks to His Message we are well aware today of the
importance of Freedom, Justice, Equality ... Wisdom,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
Knowledge, Understanding ... Food, Clothing, Shelter ...
Love, Peace and Happiness, in sufficient quantity and quality,
while we are living. This great teacher has filled us
with a desire to rest not, until we have our own righteous
nation, united together under ALLAH, the One God,
wherein brotherhood is a practiced reality instead of a
future dream or a &#8220;far-away promise&#8221; as it is in the Christian
religion of our slave master.</p>

<p>Even you must bear witness that Messenger Muhammad
is without question the most fearless and uncompromising
representative of Almighty God, ALLAH, and His Religion
of Islam. Messenger Muhammad doesn&#8217;t offer any apology
to this wicked race, nor to the fearful and unbelieving
&#8220;Uncle Toms&#8221; among our own kind. He has a Message from
God. It is a warning of condemnation of the wicked, and
despite all opposition he goes right ahead, boldly delivering
his message.</p>

<p>He says (as Noah, Lot, and Moses did before him) that
you can take it or leave it. So many of you will say that
you believe in Almighty God, ALLAH; but, yet you hesitate
to teach the naked truth, for fear of hurting the tender
feelings of this wicked white race. Since you are filled with
fear of the beast (Rev. 21:8), instead of standing in the
way, holding up progress, hardening your hearts with envy,
jealousy, and unbelief ... step out of his way so he can
prove to the world that there is no God but ALLAH, and
that this Great God ALLAH has come to redeem His long-lost
people ... the so-called Negroes of America (Rev.
7:2).</p>

<p>According to the bible, destruction of the slave master by
Almighty God can no longer be avoided nor delayed. And,
oh how well the slave master (modern Pharaoh) knows
this. Yes, this government, which was founded upon the
slavery and suffering of God&#8217;s &#8220;chosen people,&#8221; is quite
upset today because of the teachings of Messenger Muhammad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
(the modern Moses), the same as the biblical Pharaoh
was.</p>

<p>Government agents have visited and questioned me so
persistently and thoroughly that I spent many a sleepless
night wondering what it is about the presence of this little
meek and humble man that has them so terribly concerned
and upset.</p>

<p>Yes, they visited and questioned many of his followers,
but the more they visit and question us the more clearly
we are able to see and know that this is indeed a Divine
Man, God-sent to us poor slaves (Exodus 3:6-10), with
truth that forever frees us from fear of this wicked, modern
Pharaoh.</p>

<p>This little black man has not been to college; his formal
education in the slave master&#8217;s school system is very limited,
and he is not eloquent in his speech (Ex. 4:10),
whereas these government agents who question us are
highly trained and well schooled in all the modern sciences
of life. They are well learned, yet the teachings of this little
&#8220;unlearned&#8221; man has them hurt, confused, and upset. The
average unlearned man cannot upset a learned person ...
unless he has been given something by the MOST
LEARNED ONE, the All-Knowing One, Almighty God,
ALLAH Himself.</p>

<p>All praise is due to ALLAH! How well He has enabled
us to see that this little meek and humble man is he of
whom the bible says: &#8220;How knoweth this man letters (such
great wisdom) having never learned (being unlearned)
...&#8221; (John 7:15). No man in history has ever fit such a
prophetic picture more perfectly than this little &#8220;unlearned&#8221;
man who is teaching us today with such great authority.</p>

<p>Yes, he may be &#8220;unlearned&#8221; according to the educational
standards of the slave master, but he has been well
schooled by Almighty God, ALLAH Himself ... for he
tells us constantly that his doctrine (message) is not his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
own but was authored by the One God, ALLAH, who sent
him (John 7:15).</p>

<p>All praise is due ALLAH! A man born in Georgia, mentally
blind, deaf, and dumb, as ignorant as all the rest of us.
Yet we see him today upsetting the slave master&#8217;s health,
just as biblical Moses did in ancient times to the slave master
of that day (Ex. 5:2), simply by declaring God&#8217;s plan to
give these poor slaves (America&#8217;s so-called Negroes) a
land of our own, wherein we won&#8217;t have to beg any slave
master any more for &#8220;civil rights,&#8221; for we shall then have
in our own land a righteous government, wherein FREEDOM,
JUSTICE, and EQUALITY and all the other essentials
of life will be natural products, flowing for us and to
us ... like &#8220;milk and honey.&#8221;</p>

<p>In the Holy Quran it says: &#8220;He it is who raised from
among the ILLITERATES a Messenger from among themselves,
who recites to them the book and the wisdom ...
although they were before in manifest error.&#8221; (62:2.)</p>

<p>Also, &#8220;Those who follow the Messenger-Prophet, the
ILLITERATE ONE, whom they find in the Torah and the
Gospel. He enjoins them good, and forbids them evil, and
makes lawful to them good things and prohibits for them
impure things, and removes from them their burden and
the shackles which were on them. So those who believe in
Him and help Him, these are the successful.&#8221; (7:157.)</p>

<p>I, myself, being one who was lost and dead, buried here
in the rubbish of the West, in the thickest darkness of sin
and ignorance, hoodwinked completely by the false teaching
of the slave master, am able to stand upright today,
PERPENDICULAR, on the square with my God, ALLAH,
and my own kind (in the East) ... able for the first time
in 400 years to SEE and HEAR.</p>

<p>I bear witness that Almighty God, ALLAH, is the Finder
of the lost sheep (American Negroes) and the Life-Giver to
the dead. He, ALLAH, is the only Saviour for the 20,000,000<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
so-called Negroes, who were kidnaped by the white
race and enslaved here in America.</p>

<p>Also, I bear witness that Messenger Elijah Muhammad
has been taught (raised) by this Great God of the Universe,
the Architect of the Universe, the Supreme Being
Himself, ALLAH. And I bear witness that Messenger
Elijah Muhammad is in turn raising us from the dead
today, teaching us TRUTH, and raising us from the dead
level of ignorance.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">5. MALCOLM X AT<br />
QUEENS COLLEGE</h3></div>

<p>Mr. Muhammad Speaks <i>is the official newspaper of the
Black Muslim movement. It is a highly charged, well-edited
propaganda sheet of some thirty-six pages. One recent edition
carried the full text of a speech Malcolm X delivered at
Queens College in New York. More interesting than the
speech&mdash;at least I feel so&mdash;is the way the editors of the
paper led into the text. Here is a clear example of how
Black Muslims are informed about what their leaders are
doing. The paper had a circulation of over fifty thousand
a year ago, and I suspect it has all but doubled that now.
The picture painted here is that of their second-in-command,
Malcolm X, issuing words of wisdom in the places
of higher learning. Of particular interest is the description
of students skipping class to question Malcolm.</i></p>

<p><i>I was not at Queens College, but I have been with
Malcolm&mdash;most of the time to debate with him&mdash;at other
universities. And I know this scene to be valid. Whether
people believe Malcolm X is one thing, but there can be</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
<i>no doubt that they come in droves&mdash;particularly white
people&mdash;to hear him. And they always linger to ask questions.</i></p>

<blockquote>

<p>New York Minister Malcolm X continued his series of
successful presentations of the teachings of the Honorable
Elijah Muhammad in Boston, St. Louis and New York, during
the past few weeks.</p>

<p>On Tuesday, May 24th, Malcolm X spoke at the Boston
Theological Seminary in Boston, Mass. The prior week
Malcolm X was heard by several hundred St. Louis Negroes
who jammed Carpenter&#8217;s Hall, where Malcolm X said,
&#8220;America must give Negroes full freedom or face disaster.&#8221;
Malcolm went on to say that complete and total separation
resulting in the Negro having a few states of his own is the
only solution to the so-called Negro problem.</p>

<p>Upwards of two hundred students [gathered] in room one
hundred of the Remsen Building at New York&#8217;s Queens
College last month to hear Minister Malcolm X, head of
Muhammad Temple of Islam Number Seven, defend the
doctrine of Islam as taught by the Honorable Elijah
Muhammad.</p>

<p>The students gathered at the invitation of the Queens
College Chapter of the NAACP and heard Minister Malcolm
say, &#8220;the American black man faces a unique situation
because of his unique position in America. This is why so
many American black men are turning to Islam and also
why Islam must be presented to them in a form peculiar
to the circumstances they face. This causes many people
to say we are not teaching the orthodox form of Islam.&#8221;
Minister Malcolm continued, &#8220;This is not true. We are
teaching the true Islamic faith but we are making it applicable
to the peculiar conditions faced by the American
black man.&#8221;</p>

<p>Asked to comment on Mr. Muhammad&#8217;s twelve point
program for the salvation of the American Negro, Minister
Malcolm said, &#8220;our central teaching as far as the social
action of the American black man is concerned is that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
should be separated from his slave masters. As the Bible
says, &#8216;let every man be under his own vine and fig tree.&#8217;
Mr. Muhammad teaches that the American black man, like
the children of Israel, are strangers, not in a land of their
own.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Much of the unrest now current would be eliminated,&#8221;
Minister Malcolm said, &#8220;if the request of Mr. Muhammad
were granted. Once the slave is educated he wants to be
equal with his master, to share his master&#8217;s property. If
the slave is as well educated as the master then the slave
will no longer be content to serve. That is the core of the
racial unrest in America today. That is why we must be
separated and allowed to become a people self-sufficient
and self-supporting.&#8221;</p>

<p>The appearance of Minister Malcolm was scheduled to
last for fifty-five minutes but the interest was such that
scores of students remained out of classes to continue discussions
with Minister Malcolm for an hour past the stated
deadline.</p>

<p>The following is a complete transcript of Minister
Malcolm&#8217;s Queens College speech:</p></blockquote>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">We thank you</span> for inviting us here today to present our
views on this topic: &#8220;The Negro&#8217;s Position in the Recent
American Society.&#8221; But, to understand our views you must
first know something about our religion, Islam.</p>

<p>The Creator of the Universe, whom many of you call
God or Jehovah, is known to the Muslims by the name
ALLAH. Since the Muslims believe all prophets came
from that ONE GOD and therefore all taught one and the
same religion, rightly called ISLAM, which means the complete
submission and obedience to ALLAH.</p>

<p>One who practices this Divine Obedience is called a
Muslim (commonly known, spelled, and referred to here in
the West as Moslem).</p>

<p>There are over 600 million Muslims on this earth, predominantly
in Africa and Asia, and we here in America<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
under the Divine Guidance of Mr. Elijah Muhammad are
an integral part of the vast World of Islam that stretches
from the China Seas to the sunny shores of West Africa.</p>

<p>A unique situation faces the black man here in America
because of his unique condition, thus his acceptance of
Islam and into Islam affects him uniquely ... differently
than all other converts to Islam.</p>

<p>Mr. Elijah Muhammad is our Divine Leader and Teacher
here in America. He believes in and obeys God 100 per
cent and is teaching and working among us to fulfill God&#8217;s
Divine Purpose.</p>

<p>What is this purpose? God&#8217;s purpose today (just as it
was in biblical days) is the complete SEPARATION of the
so-called Negroes from their slave master ... as the bible
says concerning today: &#8220;Let every man be under his own
vine and fig tree.&#8221;</p>

<p>The best biblical example of this is the enslavement of
the Hebrews in the land of Egypt under Pharaoh ... a
free man and some slaves who were &#8220;strangers in a land
not their own,&#8221; and how Jehovah chose Moses to SEPARATE
them from their slave master.</p>

<p>Since the slave master today declares his &#8220;former&#8221; slaves
are free, Mr. Muhammad says that for the betterment of our
future and that of our former slave master God has declared
we also must be SEPARATED.</p>

<p>To many of you here in this college auditorium, this
sounds ridiculous; to some it even sounds insane. But 20
million black people here in America now number a nation
in their own right. Do you believe a nation WITHIN another
nation can be successful? Especially when they both
have equal education?</p>

<p>Once the slave has his master&#8217;s education, the slave
wants to be like his master, wants to share his master&#8217;s
property, and wants to exercise the same privileges as his
master.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>This is the CORE of America&#8217;s troubles today; and there
will be no peace for America as long as 20 million so-called
Negroes are here BEGGING for the equal rights which
America knows she will never grant us.</p>

<p>Even the limited education America has granted her
ex-slaves has already produced great unrest ... and Almighty
God says the only way for America to ever have
peace is for us to be SEPARATED from her ... and therefore
Mr. Muhammad teaches us that we must have some
land of our own.</p>

<p>If we receive equal education, how long do you expect
us to remain your passive servants, or second-class citizens?
There is no such thing as second-class citizens. We
are FULL CITIZENS or we are not citizens at all!</p>

<p>When you teach a man the science of government he
wants an equal part (or position) in that government ...
or else he wants to be a master in that government himself.
He demands equality with his master.</p>

<p>No man with equal education will serve you. The only
way you can continue to rule us is with a superior knowledge,
or by continuing to hold equal education from our
people.</p>

<p>America has not given us equal education, but she has
given us enough to make us want more ... and to make
us demand equality of opportunity ... which is causing
great unrest.</p>

<p>Thus, the only SOLUTION is complete SEPARATION!</p>

<p>You believe in the fulfillment of biblical prophecy, that a
great DAY OF SEPARATION is coming, and that the
knowledge of truth will cause this SEPARATION. We are
living at that time today!</p>

<p>You are not common people here in this college audience.
You are students, scholars, professors; you have education
enough to weigh current events as well as history against
the truth of what Mr. Muhammad is teaching.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>For over 300 years our parents served yours. During
slavery our parents didn&#8217;t ask your parents for civil rights.
Our parents did not have enough education to do so.</p>

<p>They were taught by their educated white masters that
they were born inferiors ... born to serve the whites ...
&#8220;superior&#8221; whites who restricted them without citizenship
even after the so-called emancipation proclamation.</p>

<p>Today Mr. Muhammad sees nothing but the DESTRUCTION
of both races if they stay together. INTEGRATION
will cause DISINTEGRATION of both.</p>

<p>A child stays within the mother until the time of birth.
When the time of birth arrives, the child must be SEPARATED,
or it will DESTROY its mother and itself. The
mother can&#8217;t carry that child after its time.</p>

<p>The child wants to be free; it cries for a world of its own.
If the mother will not give it up NATURALLY, the doctors
must forcibly take it from her ... which sometimes causes
her death.</p>

<p>If she can set it free naturally and easily, so much the
better ... if not, it must be TAKEN.</p>

<p>Twenty million so-called Negroes in America today number
a nation WITHIN a nation and are crying for FREEDOM.
We must be freed. We must be born. We must be
SEPARATED ... or cause the DESTRUCTION of both!</p>

<p>SEPARATION is the only solution today. Is this insane?
Is this so ridiculous?</p>

<p>During slavery our parents would have been put to death
for advocating integration with the white man ... and now
that God has declared this is the DAY OF SEPARATION,
the white man wants (or at least is TALKING about) integration
with his ex-slave.</p>

<p>America can solve her present problems and avoid a
worse crisis by setting up some SEPARATE STATES for
us right here in America.</p>

<p>Remember the Hebrews in biblical Egypt ... after their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
400 years of bondage to Pharaoh were up, God had to fulfill
his promise to them that he had made through Abraham
... but their biblical slave master would not let
them go.</p>

<p>Thus it cost the slave master his own freedom, his country,
and his life for opposing God&#8217;s Plan to SEPARATE His
people from their slave master and set them in a land of
their own.</p>

<p>God would not have DESTROYED the slave master if
he would have listened ... but just as America is today,
the biblical slave master (Pharaoh) was also too rich, too
strong, and too proud to listen to Moses ... whom they
contemptuously looked upon only as an inarticulate ex-slave.</p>

<p>Mr. Muhammad is opposed today, both by his own
people and by whites, simply because he advocates complete
FREEDOM, JUSTICE, and EQUALITY for America&#8217;s
20 million so-called Negroes.</p>

<p>America is a free nation. Why should America oppose
Mr. Muhammad for teaching FREEDOM for her 20 million
so-called Negroes?</p>

<p>He is not asking for an &#8220;integrated society&#8221; which would
only lead to the dreaded INTERMARRIAGE with America&#8217;s
white sons and daughters ... he is demanding complete
SEPARATION where we will have complete FREEDOM,
JUSTICE, and EQUALITY in a land of our own.</p>

<p>And, if God is with Mr. Muhammad today to SEPARATE
us and put us in a land wherein we can form our
own nation equal with other civilized nations ... would
you want God to DESTROY your country like he did biblical
Egypt ... for opposing HIS DIVINE PLAN?</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">6. MALCOLM X<br />
AT YALE</h3></div>


<p><i>Speaking, as always, in behalf of &#8220;The Honorable Elijah
Muhammad,&#8221; Malcolm X journeyed to Yale University in
1962 to debate with Herbert Wright, then National Youth
Secretary of the NAACP.</i></p>

<p><i>The first third of this Yale Speech is Malcolm&#8217;s attempt
to put the Black Muslims&#8217; doctrine in world perspective.
One may dispute, as Herbert Wright did, the lessons
Malcolm draws from current history, but this lecture shows
once again how the Black Muslims are struggling to give
their doctrine the advantages of learning and information.
Malcolm&#8217;s point is that the world situation demands that
the American Negro have a separate state and that even
such threats as the Communist take-over in Cuba will not
subside until that all-Negro state is brought into being.</i></p>

<p><i>This talk has a particularly scorching indictment of middle-class
Negroes. Several people who were present at the
debate have told me that Herbert Wright became difficult
at times, for Malcolm, and that Malcolm responded with an
unusual amount of bile. This was one of a series of debates</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
<i>between Wright and Malcolm X, and the NAACP finally
ordered a halt to the encounters.</i></p>

<p><i>Remembering that the Black Muslims have a prohibition
against voting, the reader will be particularly interested
in Malcolm&#8217;s arguments as to why the majority of American
Negroes do not vote. He sees this apathy at the polls as a
rebellion against &#8220;integration-minded&#8221; Negro leadership.
And this may be a commentary on why the Muslims have
themselves decided to enter politics.</i></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">In behalf of</span> my beloved leader and teacher, The Honorable
Elijah Muhammad, and the many young Muslims
who follow him, we wish to thank you for this opportunity
to explain our position today in what we feel to be the only
solution to the serious race problems confronting America
and the entire troubled Western World.</p>

<p>In this crucial hour in which we live today, it is essential
that our minds constantly be kept open to reality. We
have both races here in this Yale Law School Auditorium
tonight. Let us not be emotional. Let us be governed and
guided only by facts.</p>

<p>I represent Mr. Elijah Muhammad, the spiritual head of
the fastest-growing group of Black Muslims in the Western
Hemisphere. We who follow him know that he has been
divinely taught and sent to us by God Himself. We believe
that the miserable plight of the 20 million black people in
America is the fulfillment of divine prophecy. We believe
that the serious race problem that our presence here poses
for America is also the fulfillment of divine prophecy. We
also believe the presence today in America of The Honorable
Elijah Muhammad, his teachings among the so-called
Negroes, and his naked warning to America concerning her
treatment of these so-called Negroes is all the fulfillment of
divine prophecy.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>Thus, when Mr. Muhammad declares that the only solution
to America&#8217;s race problem is complete separation of
the two races, he is fulfilling that which was predicted by
all of the biblical prophets to take place in this day. But,
because Mr. Muhammad takes this uncompromising stand,
those who don&#8217;t understand biblical prophecy wrongly
label him as a racist and as a hate teacher, or as being anti-white,
or as teaching Black Supremacy. So tonight, while
we are all here together, face to face, we can question and
examine for ourselves the wisdom or the folly of what Mr.
Muhammad is teaching.</p>

<p>Studying world conditions in the light of facts, facing
reality as grown men and women ... seeing things not as
we would like them to be, but as they really are ... only
then can we determine the rightness, the validity, the
divine origin of Mr. Muhammad and the solution which he
offers as the only hope for America&#8217;s 20 million so-called
Negroes, and also as the only hope for this troubled Western
World.</p>

<p>If Mr. Muhammad&#8217;s solution is from God, is it in time to
save 20 million so-called Negroes? Is it in time to save
America? Is it in time to save the Western World? Let us
look closely and see.</p>

<p>The Western World finds itself today constantly engulfed
in crisis after crisis. The ingredients for disaster lurk constantly
on all sides ... both at home and abroad. The Western
World&#8217;s leading diplomats are whispering in the halls
of the UN that catastrophe can come any moment, any
hour, any second.</p>

<p>Whether this grave crisis be studied at the international
level, the national level, or the local level, we will discover
the primary ingredient always encountered, in one form or
another, is the race issue ... the race question ... the race
problem. Whether it is the Congo, Algeria, South Africa,
China, Cuba, or Panama.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>Let us take the advice Paul gave in the bible; let us toss
our emotions aside and reason together. Let us look closely
at this chaotic world-picture before us, and in the light of
the facts let us then determine if Mr. Muhammad&#8217;s divine
solution fits the picture before us.</p>

<p>But many of you may be asking yourselves: &#8220;Why should
we listen to this little so-called Negro ... this little Georgia-born
ex-slave? What can he do? What can he tell us?&#8221;</p>

<p>Well, my friends, the Western World&#8217;s most learned diplomats
have failed to solve this grave race problem. Her
learned politicians have failed. Her learned theologians
have failed. Her learned legal experts have failed. Her
sociologists have failed. Her civil leaders have failed. Her
fraternal leaders have even failed.</p>

<p>Since the Western World&#8217;s most skillful scientists and
scholars have failed to solve this race problem, it is time for
us to sit down tonight and reason together, and I&#8217;m certain
we will be forced to agree that it takes God Himself to
solve this grave racial dilemma. When we face these facts,
we see the necessity for DIVINE intervention ... we see
the necessity for a DIVINE SOLUTION.</p>

<p>If God is going to intervene, will He come Himself, or
will He send someone with His solution? Will we be able
to accept this divine solution when it comes? How will we
know if the Messenger who brings us the solution is really
a man from God? What yardstick will we use to measure
him?</p>

<p>Will this man of God be someone from Harvard, Yale,
Columbia, Howard, or Tuskegee? Will this man of God be
a black man or a white man?</p>

<p>Will he be a theologian or preacher from one of the prevailing
religions of the Western World? Will he be a politician
from one of the major political parties? What type of
man do you think God would choose to deliver His solution
to this troubled Western World? How are we to determine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
whether or not Mr. Muhammad is a man from
God? And, how are we to determine if it is time for God
Himself to intervene?</p>

<p>Let us not be emotional; let us reason together. Look
around us at the condition of the world. Never before has
man had in his hands the power to destroy human life on
such a vast scale. Never before has there been such propaganda,
mass lies, mass suspicion, mass confusion, mass dissatisfaction,
mass unrest, mass hatreds ... and the ingredients
for such mass bloodshed.</p>

<p>Never before has America made so many crucial blunders,
one after another, and suffered such great loss of
prestige in the eyes of the world, despite the advice of her
expert advisors.</p>

<p>The U-2 spy plane incident caused the President of the
strongest country on earth to be tricked, trapped and exposed
before the whole world as a liar ... despite the advice
of expert advisors.</p>

<p>At the Paris Summit Conference, the same President
was cursed, ridiculed, and humiliated again before the eyes
of the entire world ... despite the advice of his expert
advisors.</p>

<p>In Korea, students, mere children, toppled the government
of Syngman Rhee, the best friend America had in the
Far East, despite the advice of her expert advisors.</p>

<p>In Turkey, children toppled the government of Menderes,
America&#8217;s best friend in the Middle East ... despite the
advice of expert advisors.</p>

<p>In Tokyo, students, mere children again, defied the President
to come to Japan, and blocked him from entering
after he had traveled thousands of miles from home and
had arrived at their back door ... a most humiliating
insult ... despite the advice of his expert advisors.</p>

<p>And Cuba, a little midget island-government in the Caribbean,
is challenging Giant America, accusing her of economic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
aggression, confiscating all of her investments, and
getting unexpected support from Mexico and other strategically
located Latin American countries ... and all of
this, despite the advice of her expert advisors.</p>

<p>My friends, if the expert politicians, the expert theologians,
the expert diplomats and other scientists, professors
and scholars have failed to devise a solution to these
grave world problems, surely you will agree that it is now
time for God to send us someone with a solution from
Himself.</p>

<p>Is Mr. Muhammad from God? Is he on time? Does his
divine solution fit the events of today?</p>

<p>Look at the racial volcano that has erupted in the Congo,
with the ingredients present for an even greater racial explosion
building up into what could easily touch off the
dreaded 3rd World War ... and once again the diplomats
in the UN are whispering that Western Civilization is tottering
on the brink of disaster.</p>

<p>Why are the Africans in the Congo rising against the
white Belgian oppressors? Why are the Africans in Kenya
rising against their white British oppressors? Why are the
Africans in Angola rising against their white Portuguese
oppressors? Why are the Africans in Algeria rising against
their white French oppressors? In short: Why is the black
man today all over Africa rising up against his white
European overlords?</p>

<p>In the Congo, Central Africa, the black man is saying,
&#8220;We must have our own land.&#8221; In Kenya, East Africa, the
black man is saying, &#8220;We must have our own land.&#8221; In Angola,
West Africa, the black man is saying, &#8220;We must have
our own land.&#8221; In Algeria, North Africa, the black man is
saying, &#8220;We must have our own land.&#8221; Even deep into
South Africa, all over the entire African continent, the only
solution in the minds of the awakening black man is: &#8220;We
must have our own land.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>The cry of the black man in Africa for the return of his
own land is so widespread, so unrelenting, so uncompromising
... it stands to reason that only God Himself is inspiring
him and driving him onward in this spirit of
freedom. If God has made the black man in Africa realize
he cannot rest until he has some land of his own ... surely
that same God will look westward toward America and see
20 million black people here, SECOND-CLASS CITIZENS,
who are also in dire need of some land that we can call
our own.</p>

<p>If Mr. Muhammad says &#8220;some land of our own&#8221; is God&#8217;s
solution to this grave race problem, why land? Why is land
so important to everyone today?</p>

<p>The white man in Great Britain could once boast that
his control extended over so much of the black man&#8217;s land
that the sun never set on the British Empire. Today, when
the sun rises, we can hardly find the British Empire.</p>

<p>How important is land? Well, look what happened to the
British Empire when she lost the lands she had colonized
in Asia: lands like India, China, Burma, Malaya, etc. ...
her inability to continue robbing Asia of the natural resources
produced by the land almost wrecked the British
economy, decreased her military strength and her political
prestige so low she could no longer use &#8220;force&#8221; to hold her
African colonies.</p>

<p>As her grip on the black man&#8217;s land loosened, Britain
dwindled. Loss of land meant loss of Empire ... loss of
wealth, power, and of prestige.</p>

<p>As the black men in Africa and Asia regain control over
their lands, the French, Belgians, Dutch, Portuguese, Spanish,
and all other European Empires also begin to crumble
and topple downward....</p>

<p>As we face these facts, we are forced to agree that the
economy of white Europe, the military power of white
Europe, and the political prestige of white Europe was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
based upon the lands in Africa and Asia which they had
taken from the BLACK MAN.</p>

<p>The combined powers of white Europe have not been
able to stem this black tide in Africa that is sweeping aside
the shackles of colonial slavery. The Africans have become
militant and are marching toward freedom. Africa is the
only continent where a new nation is being born every
day ... and these new nations are taking their seats in the
family of other independent nations symbolized by the
United Nations.</p>

<p>And, this fast-growing black block formed by these
newly born African nations, united with our Darker Brothers
in Asia, can already easily out-vote the white colonial
powers in the UN who had formerly enslaved them. These
newly born independent black nations can also take a firm
stand in behalf of other black people all over the world
who are still enslaved, persecuted, exploited ... or deprived
of their basic rights.</p>

<p>As the rise of these newly independent black nations
collapses the economic, military, and political strength of
America&#8217;s allies in white Europe, what effect does this
have upon white America?</p>

<p>Does white America face the same black web in which
the colonial powers of white Europe find themselves entangled?
And, if so, how will this affect America&#8217;s attitude
toward the black people of Africa? How will this affect
America&#8217;s attitude toward the 20 million black people who
are yet suffering the bondage of so-called second-class
citizenship right here in America ... 20 million so-called
Negroes who have also been deprived of freedom, justice,
and equality ... 20 million so-called Negroes who not only
have been deprived of their civil rights, but who have
even been deprived of their HUMAN RIGHTS ... the right
to hold their heads up, and to live in dignity like other
human beings.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>Let us not be emotional, but let us face these facts. Let
us reason together. This has become a serious problem for
America, and for the entire world.</p>

<p>Will the Divine Solution that God has given Mr. Elijah
Muhammad help white America avert the racial dilemma
in which the awakening dark nations of Africa and Asia
have already placed America&#8217;s allies in white Europe?</p>

<p>Before we can intelligently decide to accept or reject
Mr. Muhammad&#8217;s solution, let us take a closer look at
America itself:</p>

<p>America is the richest and most powerful nation on this
earth. Her President is almost like a &#8220;god,&#8221; for he has in
his hands almost every other country on this earth. Therefore,
every four years, when a new President, or &#8220;god,&#8221; is
about to be selected, the eyes of even the foreign nations
are turned toward the American elections ... for they too
are wondering who, what type of man, will be the next
&#8220;god.&#8221;</p>

<p>Yet, at the two great political conventions in which the
two candidates are selected, despite America&#8217;s need to
impress, and favorably influence the foreign nations, foreign
policy is never the great controversial issue ... the
controversial issue is always over domestic policy ... the
CIVIL RIGHTS ISSUE ... in which the so-called American
Negro is the primary figure ... the STAR on the world
stage ... for it is he who holds the balance of power in all
elections ... it is he who can easily determine &#8220;who&#8221; will
be the next &#8220;god.&#8221;</p>

<p>Therefore, this great political drama not only stars the
Negro, but all the political schemes are designed primarily
to woo him, to please him, to tempt him, ensnare him, to
get his allegiance and capitalize upon his political support.</p>

<p>The Negro&#8217;s position is most strategic, but his mental
condition is too pathetic for him to take intelligent advantage
of this vital position &#8220;fate&#8221; has placed him in. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
American Negro is suffering from a mental sickness. His
mind has been &#8220;tampered&#8221; with by his slave master.</p>

<p>The Western World is sick. America is sick ... but the
Negro in America is the sickest of them all. The sickening
condition of the Negro in America is infecting Uncle Sam&#8217;s
entire body and endangering the security and future of the
whole Western World.</p>

<p>Mr. Muhammad says that only after the American Negro&#8217;s
condition is &#8220;corrected&#8221; will Uncle Sam&#8217;s health improve
... for only then will Uncle Sam look &#8220;healthy&#8221; in
the inquiring eyes of the fast-awakening dark world.</p>

<p>Since we see the vital necessity of correcting the miserable
condition of the American Negro, and we must also
agree that all other efforts to solve this problem have
failed, will Mr. Muhammad&#8217;s &#8220;prescription&#8221; cure the ailments
of these 20 million second-class citizens?</p>

<p>Many of you will say: &#8220;No! Muhammad is a Black
Supremist. He is an extremist. He stresses race too much.
He is a racist.&#8221;</p>

<p>My friends: If you were to see a man attired in white,
with a sharp instrument in his hands, bending over someone
who is prostrate on a table, your lack of understanding
might compel you to shout, &#8220;murderer!&#8221;</p>

<p>But when you know the place is a hospital, the sleeping
man is a patient, the man attired in white is a surgeon,
and the sharp instrument must be used to perform some
surgery that is necessary to save the patient&#8217;s life ... you
can then accept the fact that although the operation is
very painful, it must be performed.</p>

<p>Uncle Sam is sick, because he has a black &#8220;lump&#8221; growing
in his white body that doesn&#8217;t belong there, and this
black &#8220;growth&#8221; is getting larger every day, and increasing
Uncle Sam&#8217;s internal pains. God Himself has ordained that
this surgery must be performed, for if the 20 million rapidly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
increasing so-called Negroes are not separated from the
white parts of the body, it will soon cause the death and
destruction of Uncle Sam.</p>

<p>God has given Mr. Muhammad some sharp truth. It is
like a two-edged sword. It cuts into you. It causes you great
pain, but if you can take it, it will cure you and save you
from what otherwise would be CERTAIN DEATH.</p>

<p>In your mental anguish many of you will emotionally
insist that Mr. Muhammad is not teaching the real religion
of Islam. You will still insist that he is teaching a racial,
economic, and political philosophy.</p>

<p>My friends, Islam is the religion taught by all of the
prophets: Noah, Lot, Abraham, Moses, and even Jesus.
Islam is the true name of the religion God gave to the
prophets in the past to cure their people of whatever moral
or spiritual ailments that were afflicting them in that day.</p>

<p>Since we have examined the ailments of the crumbling
Western World, and the ills that are infecting America ...
let us look more closely at the miserable condition of the
American Negro:</p>

<p>Here are 20 million people who have lost their original
identity; they cannot even speak their own mother tongue.
How can 20 million people lose their language? What happened
to it? What was it? Why don&#8217;t they at least know
what it was?</p>

<p>Why don&#8217;t the educated Negroes know something about
their own history, their own culture, the last names of their
forefathers, their own nationality, their own country, their
own flag, their own religion, and their own God?</p>

<p>My friends, surely you will agree that no other people in
history, biblical or otherwise, have been so completely
stripped and robbed by their slave master of all knowledge
concerning their own kind ... and because of this, no other
people in history, biblical or otherwise, have ever presented<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
such a problem to their former slave masters or to
the world ... as the problem created by the presence of
the 20 million so-called Negroes here in America today.</p>

<p>The New York <i>Tribune</i>, in an editorial (Feb. 5, 1960),
pointed out that out of 11 million qualified Negro voters,
only 2,700,000 actually took time to vote. This means that,
roughly speaking, only 3 million of the 11 million Negroes
who are qualified to vote take an active part ... and the
remaining 8 million remain voluntarily inactive, and yet it
it is this small minority of Negro voters who help determine
who will be the next President.</p>

<p>If who will be the next President can be influenced by 3
million Negro voters, it is easy to see why the presidential
candidates of both political parties put on such a false
show with the civil rights bill, and with promises of integration.
They must woo or impress the 3 million voting Negroes
who are the actual &#8220;integration seekers.&#8221;</p>

<p>If so much fuss is made over these 3 million &#8220;integration
seekers,&#8221; what would the presidential candidates have to
do to appease the 8 million non-voting Negroes if they ever
decided to become politically active in this election year?</p>

<p>Who are the 8 million non-voting Negroes, what do they
want, and why don&#8217;t they vote?</p>

<p>The 3 million voters are the so-called middle- (or high-)
class Negroes, referred to by Howard University Sociology
Professor E. Franklin Frazier, as the &#8220;BLACK BOURGEOISIE,&#8221;
who have been educated to think as patriotic
individualists, with no racial pride ... who believe in,
and look forward to, the future &#8220;integrated-intermarried&#8221;
society promised them by the Negro politicians ... and
therefore, this &#8220;integration-minded&#8221; 3 million remain an
active part of the white-controlled political parties. But it
must never be overlooked, that these 3 million integration
seekers are only a small minority of the 11 million qualified
voters.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>The 8 million non-voting Negroes are the majority, the
downtrodden black masses. They have refused to vote, or
to take part in politics, because they reject the Uncle Tom
approach of the &#8220;clergy-politician&#8221; leadership that has
been hand-picked for the American Negroes by the white
man himself.</p>

<p>The clergy-politician leadership does not speak for the
Negro majority; they don&#8217;t speak for the black masses.
They speak for the &#8220;BLACK BOURGEOISIE,&#8221; the &#8220;brainwashed&#8221;
(white-minded) middle-class minority ... who,
because they are ashamed of black, and don&#8217;t want to be
identified with black or as being black, are seeking to lose
this &#8220;identity&#8221; by mingling, mixing, intermarrying, and integration
with the white man.</p>

<p>The race problem cannot be solved by listening to this
white-minded (brainwashed) minority. The white man
must try to learn what does the majority want. The next
President would be wise to try and learn what the black
masses want. And, the only way to find this out is by listening
to the man who speaks for the black masses of America.</p>

<p>I declare to you and to the entire world, that the man
here in America who speaks for the majority, the downtrodden,
dissatisfied black masses ... is this same man
whom so many thousands of our people are flocking toward
to see and hear ... this same Mr. Muhammad who
is labeled by you as a Black Supremist, and as a Racist!</p>

<p>If the 3 million middle-class Negroes are casting their
ballots for integration and intermarriage ... what do the
non-voting black masses who are in the minority want? Find
out what the black masses want, and then perhaps America&#8217;s
grave race problem can be solved.</p>

<p>The black masses are tired of following these hand-picked
Negro &#8220;leaders&#8221; who sound like professional beggars, as
they cry year after year for white America to accept us as
first-class citizens.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>Since this clergy-politician &#8220;leadership,&#8221; which was carefully
hand-picked for us by the white man, has failed to
solve the problem for the downtrodden black masses ...
God Himself has stepped into the picture, and has made
Messenger Elijah Muhammad a wise, fearless, and uncompromising
spokesman for the 20 million black people here
in America, who, behind the Divine Leadership of this man
of God, will now never be satisfied until we have a home
in a land that we can proudly call our own.</p>

<p>We have accepted your invitation to come here to Yale
University Law School this evening to let you know first
hand why 20 million so-called Negroes cannot integrate
with white America ... why white America, after 100 years
of religious hypocrisy and political trickery will never accept
us as first-class citizens here ... and why we must
therefore seek some separate territory of our own.</p>

<p>In your blind emotion, again many of you will cry out
that this is wrong, that this is not religion, that this is not
Islam ... that this is just another economic-political philosophy.</p>

<p>I must remind you to keep an open mind. Let your own
Christian bible be the judge:</p>

<p>You credit Moses with being a religious man, a man of
God, doing God&#8217;s work. Yet, what did Moses actually do?
What did Moses teach? Moses freed his people from their
slave master. Moses told the oppressor of his people: &#8220;Let
my people go.&#8221; Moses separated his people from their
masters, and then led them into a separate territory of
their own.</p>

<p>You admit Moses was a man of God, yet you will have
to agree Moses did not teach integration. Moses taught
separation. Moses didn&#8217;t take time to dwell on religious
practices. He just let his people know that he represented
the God of their forefathers, whose desire it was for them
to be separated from their slave master and placed in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
land that they could call their own. Mr. Muhammad&#8217;s message
and mission today is the same as that of the biblical
Moses. Mr. Muhammad is a modern Moses in this modern-day
house of bondage.</p>

<p>Many of you will cry out that you don&#8217;t go by what
Moses said or did, but rather by what Jesus said. You
claim that Jesus taught love and that Mr. Muhammad
teaches hate.</p>

<p>But, my friends, have you really read the bible? Are
you familiar with Luke 14:26 where Jesus taught: &#8220;If any
man come to me, and hate not his father, and mother, and
wife, and children, and brethren, and sisters, yes, and even
his own life also, he cannot be my disciple.&#8221;</p>

<p>In other words, Jesus taught that you must hate everyone
in your family, even your own self ... and Muhammad
teaches us to love our brothers and sisters ... yet you say
Muhammad teaches hate and that Jesus taught love.</p>

<p>Many of you will say that Jesus was no respecter of
persons, that he came to all the world. You say Muhammad
bars white people, therefore he can&#8217;t be from God.</p>

<p>My friends, Jesus told his followers to go not the way
of the Gentiles, go only to the &#8220;lost sheep.&#8221; He definitely
advised his followers to discriminate and make a distinction
between the Gentiles and the &#8220;lost sheep.&#8221;</p>

<p>But you still cry out that Jesus is coming back at the end
of the world to make us all the same, make us one people
... integrate us.</p>

<p>No, my friends, Jesus himself did not even advocate integration.
He referred to the end of this world as that
great &#8220;HARVEST TIME.&#8221; He likened the people of today
as &#8220;wheat and tares,&#8221; who would be allowed to &#8220;grow
together,&#8221; or integrated, until God comes at the end of this
world and separates the people Himself ... then He would
cause one to be burned in a Lake of Fire, and those whom
He chooses for Himself He would save.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>Jesus also spoke of the people of today as being like
&#8220;sheep and goats,&#8221; whom God would separate at the end
of the world ... some for salvation and some for destruction.</p>

<p>Jesus did not advocate integration; he advocated
SEPARATION!</p>

<p>Noah&#8217;s solution was not integration; in his day it was also
a message of separation. Lot&#8217;s solution was separation. And,
remember, my friends, Jesus warned that &#8220;as it was in the
days of Noah and Lot, so shall it be these last days&#8221; ... not
integration, but complete separation of the two races ...
or DESTRUCTION!</p>

<p>Surely you can now see that Mr. Muhammad&#8217;s message,
or solution, is the same as that of Noah, Lot, Moses, and
Jesus. How can you still doubt if Mr. Muhammad is from
God? What you really should be concerned about is has
Mr. Muhammad come in time to save you; and what must
you do now to save yourselves.</p>

<p>When Mr. Muhammad says that we must have some of
these states, before you flinch and hold up your hands in
&#8220;mock shock,&#8221; let us look and see if 20 million so-called
Negroes deserve such a solution.</p>

<p>If I were to collect the combined wages of everyone in
this Yale University Law School auditorium tonight for
just one week, I would have plenty of money. If I could
work all of you for nothing for just one year I would be
extremely rich. Well, what about the millions of black
people who worked here in America as your slaves for
over 300 years without one payday? What happened to
their wages? Who collected the profits, or amassed the fortunes
received from their free labor? Facing these unpleasant
facts, surely you can easily see now how America became
so rich so fast.</p>

<p>How will 20 million so-called Negroes today receive a
&#8220;just compensation&#8221;? We have hundreds of years&#8217; &#8220;back<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
pay&#8221; that is long overdue, and must be paid sooner or
later ... or is there to be no such things as JUSTICE for
your faithful ex-slaves?</p>

<p>The American government has appropriated billions of
dollars to pay the Indians for lands taken from their foreparents
by your foreparents.</p>

<p>Again I say, my friends, let us reason together: surely
you will agree that God is more just than your government
... yet your government has felt morally and legally
obligated to pay billions of dollars to the Indians for the
crime committed against them.</p>

<p>What about the 20 million so-called Negroes! If the
Indians must be paid for land taken from them, what
about the free labor and lives of our foreparents that were
taken from us for over 300 years?</p>

<p>If the white politicians have agreed that the Indians
should be paid for their lands ... what price or payment
will the GOD OF JUSTICE demand for 20 million black
people who were robbed of our labor, lives, identity, culture,
history ... and even our human dignity?</p>

<p>What will God&#8217;s price be? What will God&#8217;s solution be?
Can America pay God&#8217;s price? And, if not, what will be
the alternative?</p>

<p>The handwriting is on the wall for America. As America
faces crisis after crisis ... as America sees dangerous
troubles mounting on all sides ... and as America stares
with stubborn blindness, refusing to read the handwriting
on the wall ... since her &#8220;experts&#8221; have shown they are
unable to read its meaning, will America now accept an
ambassador from God, a Divine Messenger, a Warner, to
read the handwriting for her and tell her what solution
she must accept...?</p>

<p>Or, will America blindly reject God&#8217;s Messenger, and in
so doing bring on her own Divine Destruction? I trust you
will weigh well these words.</p>

A SUMMING-UP:<br />
LOUIS LOMAX INTERVIEWS<br />
MALCOLM X</h2></div>


<p><small>LOMAX</small>: Minister Malcolm, we are all by now familiar with
your basic philosophy; we have heard you speak, seen
you on television, and read your remarks in magazines and
newspapers. By now, I think, everybody knows your position
that the white man is a devil, a man incapable of
doing right; you hold that the black man is of God&#8217;s divine
nature, that he fell from power because of weakness; you
hold further that the white man&#8217;s rule over the earth was
scheduled to end in 1914, but that his end has been delayed
because of the need to get the American Negro into the
fold of black brotherhood.</p>

<p><small>MALCOLM X</small>: Yes, sir, that is what The Honorable Elijah
Muhammad teaches us. The white devil&#8217;s time is up; it has
been up for almost fifty years now. It has taken us that
long to get the deaf, dumb, and blind black men in the
wilderness of North America to wake up and understand
who they are. You see, sir, when a man understands who
he is, who God is, who the devil is ... then he can pick
himself up out of the gutter; he can clean himself up and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
stand up like a man should before his God. This is why
we teach that in order for a man to really understand himself
he must be part of a nation; he must have some land
of his own, a God of his own, a language of his own. Most
of all he must have love and devotion for his own kind.</p>

<p><small>LOMAX</small>: Wouldn&#8217;t you say the Negro has a nation&mdash;America?</p>

<p><small>MALCOLM X</small>: Sir, how can a Negro say America is <i>his</i>
nation? He was brought here in chains; he was put in
slavery and worked like a mule for three hundred years;
he was separated from his land, his culture, his God, his
language!</p>

<p>The Negro was taught to speak the white man&#8217;s tongue,
worship the white God, and accept the white man as his
superior.</p>

<p>This is a white man&#8217;s country, and the Negro is nothing
but an ex-slave who is now trying to get himself integrated
into the slave master&#8217;s house.</p>

<p>And the slave master doesn&#8217;t want you! You fought and
bled and died in every war the white man waged, and he
still won&#8217;t give you justice. You nursed his baby and
cleaned behind his wife, and he still won&#8217;t give you freedom;
you turned the other cheek while he lynched you
and raped your women, but he still won&#8217;t give you equality.
Now, you integration-minded Negroes are trying to force
yourselves on your former slave master, trying to make
him accept you in his drawing room; you want to hang
out with his women rather than with women of your own
kind.</p>

<p><small>LOMAX</small>: Are you suggesting that all of us who fight for
integration are after a white woman?</p>

<p><small>MALCOLM X</small>: I wouldn&#8217;t say <i>all</i> of you, but let the evidence
speak for itself. Check up on these integration leaders, and
you will find that most of them are either married to or
hooked up with some white woman. Take that meeting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
between James Baldwin and Robert Kennedy; practically
everybody there was interracially married. Harry Belafonte
is married to a white woman; Lorraine Hansberry is married
to a white man; Lena Horne is married to a white
man.</p>

<p>Now how can any Negro, man or woman, who sleeps
with a white person speak for me? No black person married
to a white person can speak for me!</p>

<p><small>LOMAX</small>: Why?</p>

<p><small>MALCOLM X</small>: Why? Because only a man who is ashamed
of what he is will marry out of his race. There has to be
something wrong when a man or a woman leaves his own
people and marries somebody of another kind. Men who
are proud of being black marry black women; women who
are proud of being black marry black men.</p>

<p>This is particularly true when you realize that these
Negroes who go for integration and intermarriage are linking
up with the very people who lynched their fathers,
raped their mothers, and put their kid sisters in the kitchen
to scrub floors. Why would any black man in his right
mind want to marry a lyncher, a murderer, a rapist, a dope
peddler, a gambler, a hog eater.... Why would any black
man want to marry a <i>devil</i> ... for that&#8217;s just what the
white man is.</p>

<p><small>LOMAX</small>: I have heard you say that a thousand times, but
it always jolts me. Why do you call the white man a devil?</p>

<p><small>MALCOLM X</small>: Because that&#8217;s what he is. What do you want
me to call him, a saint? Anybody who rapes, and plunders,
and enslaves, and steals, and drops hell bombs on people
... anybody who does these things is nothing but a devil.</p>

<p>Look, Lomax, history rewards all research. And history
fails to record one single instance in which the white man&mdash;as
a people&mdash;did good. They have always been devils;
they always will be devils, and they are about to be destroyed.
The final proof that they are devils lies in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
fact that they are about to destroy themselves. Only a
devil&mdash;and a stupid devil at that&mdash;would destroy himself!</p>

<p>Now why would I want to integrate with somebody
marked for destruction?</p>

<p>The Honorable Elijah Muhammad teaches us to get away
from the devil as soon and as fast as we can. This is why
we are demanding a separate state. Tell the slave master
we will no longer beg for crumbs from his table; let him
give us some land of our own so we can go for ourselves.
If he doesn&#8217;t give us some land, there is going to be hell
to pay. As I said at Howard University and Queens College,
once the white man let the Negro get an education,
the Negro began to want what the white man has. But he
let Negroes get education and now they are demanding
integration; they want to have exactly what he has. And
the white man is not going to give it to them!</p>

<p><small>LOMAX</small>: But we have made some gains....</p>

<p><small>MALCOLM X</small>: What gains? All you have gotten is tokenism&mdash;one
or two Negroes in a job or at a lunch counter so the
rest of you will be quiet. It took the United States Army
to get one Negro in the University of Mississippi; it took
troops to get a few Negroes in white schools at Little Rock
and another dozen places in the South. It has been nine
years since the Supreme Court decision outlawing segregated
schools, yet less than ten per cent of the Negro students
in the South are in integrated schools. That isn&#8217;t
integration, that&#8217;s tokenism! In spite of all the dogs, and
fire hoses, and club-swinging policemen, I have yet to read
of anybody eating an integrated hamburger in Birmingham.</p>

<p>You Negroes are not willing to admit it yet, but integration
will not work. Why, it is against the white man&#8217;s nature
to integrate you into his house. Even if he wanted to,
he could no more do it than a Model T can sprout wings
and fly. It isn&#8217;t in him.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>Now The Honorable Elijah Muhammad says it would
be the easiest thing in the world for the white man to
destroy the Black Muslims. We contend that the white man
is a devil. If he is not a devil, let him prove it!</p>

<p>He can&#8217;t do it, Lomax; it isn&#8217;t in him; it is against his
nature.</p>

<p>He&#8217;ll keep on granting tokenism; a few big Negroes will
get big jobs, but the black masses will catch hell as long
as they stay in the white man&#8217;s house.</p>

<p>The only possible way out for the white man is to give
us some land of our own; let us get out, get away from his
wicked reign and go for ourselves.</p>

<p>But the white man will not do that, either. He is going
to keep you integration-minded Negroes cooped up here
in this country, and when you discover that the white man
is a trickster, a devil, that he has no intentions of integrating,
then you Negroes will run wild. That will be the
time....</p>

<p><small>LOMAX</small>: The time for what?</p>

<p><small>MALCOLM X</small>: Only The Honorable Elijah Muhammad can
answer that!</p>

<p><small>LOMAX</small>: This is strong gospel, Minister Malcolm; many
people, Negro and white, say what you preach amounts
to hate, that your theology is actually anti-Semitic. What
is your comment to that?</p>

<p><small>MALCOLM X</small>: The white people who are guilty of white
supremacy are trying to hide their own guilt by accusing
The Honorable Elijah Muhammad of teaching black supremacy
when he tries to uplift the mentality, the social,
mental, and economic condition of the black people in this
country. Jews who have been guilty of exploiting the black
people in this country, economically, civically, and otherwise,
hide behind&mdash;hide their guilt by accusing The Honorable
Elijah Muhammad of being anti-Semitic, simply
because he teaches our people to go into business for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
ourselves and try and take over the economic leadership
in our own community.</p>

<p>And since the white people collectively have practiced
the worst form of hatred against Negroes in this country
and they know that they are guilty of it, now when The
Honorable Elijah Muhammad comes along and begins to
list the historic deed&mdash;the historic attitude, the historic behavior
of the white man in this country toward the black
people in this country, again, the white people are so guilty,
and they can&#8217;t stop doing these things to make Mr. Muhammad
appear wrong, so they hide their wrong by saying
&#8220;he is teaching hatred.&#8221; History is not hatred. Actually we
are Muslims because we believe in the religion of Islam.
We believe in one God. We believe in Muhammad as the
Apostle of God. We practice the principles of the religion
of Islam, which mean prayer, charity, fasting, brotherhood,
and The Honorable Elijah Muhammad teaches us that
since the Western society is deteriorating, it has become
overrun with immorality, that God is going to judge it and
destroy it, and the only way the black people who are in
this society can be saved is not to integrate into this
corrupt society but separate ourselves from it, reform ourselves,
lift up our moral standards and try and be godly&mdash;try
to integrate with God&mdash;instead of trying to integrate
with the white man, or try and imitate God instead of trying
to imitate the white man.</p>

<p><small>LOMAX</small>: It is suggested also that your movement preaches
violence.</p>

<p><small>MALCOLM X</small>: No, sir. The black people of this country have
been victims of violence at the hands of the white men for
four hundred years, and following the ignorant Negro
preachers, we have thought that it was godlike to turn
the other cheek to the brute that was brutalizing us. Today
The Honorable Elijah Muhammad is showing black
people in this country that, just as the white man and every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
other person on this earth has God-given rights, natural
rights, civil rights, any kind of rights that you can think
of, when it comes to defending himself, black people&mdash;we
should have the right to defend ourselves also. And, because
The Honorable Elijah Muhammad makes black people
brave enough, men enough to defend ourselves no
matter what the odds are, the white man runs around here
with a doctrine that Mr. Muhammad is advocating violence
when he is actually telling Negroes to defend themselves
against violent people.</p>

<p><small>LOMAX</small>: Reverend Martin Luther King teaches a doctrine
of nonviolence. What is your attitude toward this philosophy?</p>

<p><small>MALCOLM X</small>: The white man supports Reverend Martin
Luther King, subsidizes Reverend Martin Luther King, so
that Reverend Martin Luther King can continue to teach
the Negroes to be defenseless&mdash;that&#8217;s what you mean by
nonviolent&mdash;be defenseless in the face of one of the most
cruel beasts that has ever taken people into captivity&mdash;that&#8217;s
this American white man, and they have proved it
throughout the country by the police dogs and the police
clubs. A hundred years ago they used to put on a white
sheet and use a bloodhound against Negroes. Today they
have taken off the white sheet and put on police uniforms
and traded in the bloodhounds for police dogs, and they&#8217;re
still doing the same thing. Just as Uncle Tom, back during
slavery, used to keep the Negroes from resisting the bloodhound
or resisting the Ku Klux Klan by teaching them to
love their enemies or pray for those who use them despitefully,
today Martin Luther King is just a twentieth-century
or modern Uncle Tom or religious Uncle Tom, who is
doing the same thing today to keep Negroes defenseless
in the face of attack that Uncle Tom did on the plantation
to keep <i>those</i> Negroes defenseless in the face of the attack
of the Klan in that day.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>Now, the goal of Dr. Martin Luther King is to give
Negroes a chance to sit in a segregated restaurant beside
the same white man who has brutalized them for four
hundred years. The goal of Martin Luther King is to get
Negroes to forgive the people, the people who have brutalized
them for four hundred years, by lulling them to sleep
and making them forget what those whites have done to
them, but the masses of black people today don&#8217;t go for
what Martin Luther King is putting down.</p>

<p><small>LOMAX</small>: Minister Malcolm, you often speak of unity among
our people. Unity for what?</p>

<p><small>MALCOLM X</small>: The Honorable Elijah Muhammad teaches us
that God now is about to establish a kingdom on this earth
based upon brotherhood and peace, and the white man is
against brotherhood and the white man is against peace.
His history on this earth has proved that. Nowhere in history
has he been brotherly toward anyone. The only time
he is brotherly toward you is when he can use you, when
he can exploit you, when he will oppress you, when you
will submit to him, and since his own history makes him
unqualified to be an inhabitant or a citizen in the kingdom
of brotherhood, The Honorable Elijah Muhammad teaches
us that God is about to eliminate that particular race from
this earth. Since they are due for elimination, we don&#8217;t
want to be with them. We are not trying to integrate with
that which we know has come to the end of its rope. We
are trying to separate from it and get with something that
is more lasting, and we think that God is more lasting than
the white man.</p>

<p><small>LOMAX</small>: Then your movement does not share the integration
goals of the NAACP, CORE, Martin Luther King&#8217;s
movement, and the Student Nonviolent movement.</p>

<p><small>MALCOLM X</small>: You don&#8217;t integrate with a sinking ship. You
don&#8217;t do anything to further your stay aboard a ship that
you see is going to go down to the bottom of the ocean.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
Moses tried to separate his people from Pharaoh, and when
he tried, the magicians tried to fool the people into staying
with Pharaoh, and we look upon these other organizations
that are trying to get Negroes to integrate with this
doomed white man as nothing but modern-day magicians,
and The Honorable Elijah Muhammad is a modern-day
Moses trying to separate us from the modern-day Pharaoh.
Until the white man in America sits down and talks with
The Honorable Elijah Muhammad, he won&#8217;t even know
what the race problem&mdash;what makes the race problem
what it is. Just like Pharaoh couldn&#8217;t get a solution to his
problem until he talked to Moses, or Nebuchadnezzar or
Belshazzar couldn&#8217;t get a solution to his problem until he
talked to Daniel, the white man in America today will
never understand the race problem or come anywhere near
getting a solution to the race problem until he talks to The
Honorable Elijah Muhammad. Mr. Muhammad will give
him God&#8217;s analysis, not some kind of political analysis or
psychologist&#8217;s analysis, or some kind of clergyman&#8217;s analysis,
but God&#8217;s analysis. That&#8217;s the analysis that Moses gave
Pharaoh; that&#8217;s the analysis that Daniel gave Belshazzar.
Today we have a modern Belshazzar and a modern Pharaoh
sitting in Washington, D. C.</p>

<p><small>LOMAX</small>: I am struck by the fact that each of the biblical
figures you mentioned&mdash;Pharaoh, Nebuchadnezzar, and
Belshazzar&mdash;came to a rather sorry end. Are you willing to
complete the analogy and say the American white establishment
will come to a bitter end, perhaps be destroyed?</p>

<p><small>MALCOLM X</small>: I have spoken on this many times, and I am
sure you know what The Honorable Elijah Muhammad
teaches on this. But since we are on record I will&mdash;as they
sometimes say in Harlem&mdash;make it plain.</p>

<p>Now, sir, God is going to punish this wicked devil for
his misdeeds toward black people. Just as plagues were
visited on Pharaoh so will pestilences and disasters be visited<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
on the white man. Why, it has already started: God
has begun to send them heat when they expect cold; he
sends them cold when they expect heat. Their crops are
dying, their children are being born with all kinds of deformities,
the rivers and the lakes are coming out of the
belly of the earth to wash them away.</p>

<p>Not only that, but God has started slapping their planes
down from the sky. Last year [1962] God brought down
one of their planes loaded with crackers whose fathers had
lynched your and my brothers and sisters. They were from
your state, Lomax, down there in Georgia where both you
and Mr. Muhammad come from. Now, long before that
plane crash I predicted [in Los Angeles] that God was
going to strike back at the devil for the way white cops
brutalized our brothers in Los Angeles. When the plane
fell, I said this was God&#8217;s way of letting his wrath be
known. Now for that I was called names&mdash;some of these
Uncle Tom Negroes rushed into print to condemn me for
what I said. But what was wrong with what I said? Everybody
has a God and believes that his God will deliver
him and protect him from his enemies! Why can&#8217;t the black
man have a God? What&#8217;s so wrong when a black man says
his God will protect him from his white foe? If Jehovah
can slay Philistines for the Jews, why can&#8217;t Allah slay
crackers for the so-called Negro.</p>

<p>I said much the same thing when that submarine&mdash;the
<i>Thresher</i>&mdash;went down to the bottom of the sea. I realize
that there were some originals [Negroes] on board, but
that simply underlines my point that the so-called Negro
should not integrate with white people. He should stay as
far as possible from them at all times.</p>

<p><small>LOMAX</small>: Just a moment, if I may, Minister Malcolm. Now,
you talk about separation from the white man.</p>

<p><small>MALCOLM X</small>: Yes, sir.</p>

<p><small>LOMAX</small>: You even take it so far as to suggest that we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
shouldn&#8217;t even get on airplanes and ships with white people.
Am I correct in that?</p>

<p><small>MALCOLM X</small>: Yes, sir, on the whole. Yes.</p>

<p><small>LOMAX</small>: But Minister Malcolm, few people, Negro or white,
travel as much as you and I do. You spend much of your
life getting on and off aircraft. Don&#8217;t you fear that you just
might be aboard when God sees fit to slap down a jet and
kill a few score white people?</p>

<p><small>MALCOLM X</small>: Sir, my faith in God is such that I am not
afraid. I know that I will not die until my time comes. But
if I am aboard one of these vessels, I will be happy to give
my life to see some of these white devils die. Like Samson,
I am ready to pull down the white man&#8217;s temple, knowing
full well that I will be destroyed by the falling rubble.</p>

<p><small>LOMAX</small>: But Minister Malcolm, you make no accommodation
for the changes that have come about as a result of
the Negro Revolt. What do you think will be the results
of the current demonstrations against segregation?</p>

<p><small>MALCOLM X</small>: Lomax, as you know, these Negro leaders have
been telling the white man everything is all right, everything
is under control, and they have been telling the white
man that Mr. Muhammad is wrong, don&#8217;t listen to him.
But everything that Mr. Muhammad has been saying is
going to come to pass, is now coming to pass. Now the
Negro leaders are standing up saying that we are about to
have a racial explosion. You&#8217;re going to have a racial explosion,
and a racial explosion is more dangerous than an
atomic explosion. It&#8217;s going to explode because black people
are dissatisfied; they&#8217;re dissatisfied not only with the
white man, but they&#8217;re dissatisfied with these Negroes who
have been sitting around here posing as leaders and spokesmen
for black people and actually making the problem
worse instead of making the problem better.</p>

<p><small>LOMAX</small>: Do you deny that Negroes are now getting the
protection of the Federal Government; after all, both the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
President and the Attorney General have come to our
aid.</p>

<p><small>MALCOLM X</small>: You never will get protection from the Federal
Government. Just like King is asking Kennedy to go to
Alabama to stand in a doorway&mdash;to put his body in a doorway.
That&#8217;s like asking the fox to protect you from the
wolf! The masses of black people can see this, and it is
only the Negro leadership, the bourgeois, hand-picked,
handful of Negroes who think that they&#8217;re going to get
some kind of respect, recognition, or protection from the
Government. The Government is responsible for what is
happening to black people in this country. The President
has power. You notice he didn&#8217;t send any troops into Birmingham
to protect the Negroes when the dogs were
biting the Negroes. The only time he sent troops into
Birmingham was when the Negroes erupted, and then the
President sent the troops in there, not to protect the
Negroes, but to protect them white people down there
from those erupting Negroes.</p>

<p><small>LOMAX</small>: Are not Negroes American citizens?</p>

<p><small>MALCOLM X</small>: If they were citizens, you wouldn&#8217;t have a
race problem. If the Emancipation Proclamation was authentic,
you wouldn&#8217;t have a race problem. If the 13th,
14th, and 15th Amendments to the Constitution were authentic,
you wouldn&#8217;t have a race problem. If the Supreme
Court desegregation decision was authentic, you wouldn&#8217;t
have a race problem. All of this is hypocrisy that has been
practiced by the so-called white so-called liberal for the
past four hundred years that compounds the problem,
makes it more complicated, instead of eliminating the
problem.</p>

<p><small>LOMAX</small>: What, then, do you see as the final result of all
these demonstrations?</p>

<p><small>MALCOLM X</small>: Any time you put too many sparks around a
powder keg, the thing is going to explode, and if the thing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
that explodes is still inside the house, then the house will
be destroyed. So The Honorable Elijah Muhammad is
telling the white man, &#8220;Get this powder keg out of your
house&mdash;let the black people in this country separate from
you, while there&#8217;s still time.&#8221; If the black man is allowed
to separate and go into some land of his own where he
can solve his own problems, there won&#8217;t be any explosion,
and the Negroes who want to stay with the white man,
let them stay with the white man&mdash;but those who want to
leave, let them go with The Honorable Elijah Muhammad.</p>

<p><small>LOMAX</small>: Now that you have mentioned the Messenger, I
would like to ask you about this article in the [New York]
<i>Amsterdam News</i>....</p>

<p><small>MALCOLM X</small>: It&#8217;s a lie. Any article that says there is a
&#8220;minor&#8221; difference between Mr. Muhammad and me is a
lie. There is no such thing as a &#8220;minor&#8221; difference with the
Messenger. Any difference with him is <i>major</i>. It is a lie, a
lie, a lie somebody paid [the author] to write. I was up
there in his office yesterday and I was ready to waste
[harm, or kill] him for that. He planted a false seed, and
it could start trouble. He [the author] knows my telephone
number. If he ran on talk of a difference between me and
the Messenger, he could have called me. No, he went ahead
and printed this lie.</p>

<p>He was not there, but I told the editor of the paper
that I was out to find him; I told them to call the police
then, because as soon as I found the man who wrote this
I was going to do him in.</p>

<p>How could there be any difference between the Messenger
and me? I am his slave, his servant, his son. He is
the leader, the only spokesman for the Black Muslims.</p>

<p>But I will tell you this: The Messenger has seen God.
He was with Allah and was given divine patience with the
devil. He is willing to wait for Allah to deal with this devil.
Well, sir, the rest of us Black Muslims have not seen God,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
we don&#8217;t have this gift of divine patience with the devil.
The younger Black Muslims want to see some action.</p>

<p><small>LOMAX</small>: What kind of action?</p>

<p><small>MALCOLM X</small>: Some things are better done than said.</p>

<p><small>LOMAX</small>: According to your own newspaper, one of the
things you Muslims may <i>do</i> in the near future is vote.</p>

<p><small>MALCOLM X</small>: Yes. After long and prayerful consideration,
The Honorable Elijah Muhammad allowed us to announce
the possibility of Muslims voting. The announcement came
at our annual Saviour&#8217;s Day convention in Chicago.</p>

<p><small>LOMAX</small>: What does it mean?</p>

<p><small>MALCOLM X</small>: Mr. Muhammad is the only one who can
explain that fully. However, I can say that we may register
and be ready to vote. Then we will seek out candidates
who represent our interests and support them. They need
not be Muslims; what we want are race men who will
speak out for our people.</p>

<p><small>LOMAX</small>: There are rumors that you may run against Adam
Clayton Powell.</p>

<p><small>MALCOLM X</small>: Why must I run against a Negro? We have
had enough of Negroes running against and fighting each
other. The better bet is that we would put a Muslim candidate
in the field against a devil, somebody who is against
all we stand for.</p>

<p><small>LOMAX</small>: What are the chances of the Black Muslims joining
us in picket lines for better jobs?...</p>

<p><small>MALCOLM X</small>: As I told you, only Mr. Muhammad can answer
that. But let me tell you something: Better jobs and
housing are only temporary solutions. They are aspects of
tokenism and don&#8217;t go to the heart of the problem.</p>

<p>This is why integration will not work. It assumes that
the two races, black and white, are equal and can be made
to live as one. This is not true.</p>

<p>The white man is by nature a devil and must be destroyed.
The black man will inherit the earth; he will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
resume control, taking back the position he held centimes
ago when the white devil was crawling around the caves
of Europe on his all fours. Before the white devil came
into our lives we had a civilization, we had a culture, we
were living in silks and satins. Then he put us in chains
and placed us aboard the &#8220;Good Ship Jesus,&#8221; and we have
lived in hell ever since.</p>

<p>Now the white man&#8217;s time is over. Tokenism will not
help him, and it will doom us. Complete separation will
save us&mdash;and who knows, it might make God decide to give
the white devil a few more years.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">ABOUT THE AUTHOR</h2></div>


<p>Louis E. Lomax, one of the nation&#8217;s best-known social
critics and lecturers, was born in Valdosta, Georgia, on
August 16, 1922. Educated at Paine College, Augusta, Ga.,
American University, and Yale University, Mr. Lomax has
served on the faculty of Georgia State College, in Savannah,
as assistant professor of philosophy. His career as a
professional writer began with the <i>Afro-American</i> and subsequently
he became a staff feature writer for the Chicago
<i>American</i>. His magazine articles have appeared frequently
in <i>Harper&#8217;s, Life</i>, <i>Pageant</i>, <i>The Nation</i>, and <i>The New
Leader</i>. In 1959, when Mr. Lomax joined Mike Wallace&#8217;s
news staff in New York, he became the first Negro newsman
to appear on television. His first book, <i>The Reluctant
African</i>, was given the <i>Saturday Review</i> Anisfield-Wolf
award of 1960 for the book dealing &#8220;most creditably with
social and group relations.&#8221; His second book, <i>The Negro
Revolt</i>, was both definitive and prophetic: Lomax predicted
that Negroes would take their cause from the courtroom
into the streets and market place, and his reportorial
analysis of the forces now at work in the race struggle has
placed him among America&#8217;s foremost authorities on social
issues. One of the most sought-after lecturers in the nation
today, Mr. Lomax lives with his wife in St. Albans, New
York.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to
date contact information can be found at the Foundation's web site and
official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
